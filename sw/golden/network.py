"""Multi-pass network runner over the bit-exact LIF core golden model.

Models the multi-pass execution concept of docs/10-npu-mvp-spec.md
section 9: one physical core of at most (core_neurons x core_axons),
larger networks executed as a sequence of passes. Two pass dimensions,
exactly as specified:

  1. layer-serial — one layer (or layer tile) per pass, output spikes of
     layer L replayed as input events of layer L+1 in canonical order;
  2. output-neuron tiling (E9) — a layer wider than the core is split
     into ordered contiguous tiles; each pass replays the identical input
     event stream against one tile (PASS_TILE_OFF = tile base) and the
     per-event emissions are concatenated in tile order.

The axon dimension is not splittable in v0.1 (spec section 9 limitation);
the runner enforces fan-in <= core_axons. Tiled layer width is capped at
1024 = 2^10 (spec section 9 limitation): the last tile's base + width
must fit the frozen 10-bit event-word ID field, so the runner refuses
wider layers at construction.

Integer-only, like everything in the golden path.
