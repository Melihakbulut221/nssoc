"""Does the register-file protection survive synthesis, and is the
substitution still a drop-in?

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND WHY IT IS SEPARATE

Two questions, neither of which anything else in this repository asks.

**1. The netlist.** `docs/41` section 9.4 is the sharpest statement of
why a census is not optional: all twenty formal tasks stayed green on a
design where the synthesiser had collapsed three banks into one, and the
only check that could see it counted flip-flops in the mapped netlist.
The same shape applies here in a different way. `hw/soc/formal/
regfile_secded.sby` proves the code, `hw/soc/tb/cocotb/
test_ibex_regfile_secded.py` injects into the storage, and the campaign
of `docs/43` section 8 runs the whole SoC -- and every one of them would
pass on a netlist in which the check flip-flops had been optimised away,
because they all read the RTL, where the flip-flops exist whatever the
netlist holds.

The specific risk is real rather than theoretical: `chk_q` is, in a
fault-free design, a pure function of `data_q`, both are written from
the same enable in the same cycle, and the scrub's write-back is
`encode(decode(stored))` -- which IS the identity on a clean codeword.
A synthesiser that proved either of those would delete the protection
and leave a register file that still passes every functional test.

**2. The interface.** The substitution in `hw/soc/flow/ibex_sources.sh`
works because `hw/soc/rtl/ibex_regfile_secded.v` declares upstream's
module name with upstream's port list. If upstream's port list moves,
that stops being true. A port added or removed fails at elaboration, so
the build catches it -- but only when the build is run, and only for
whoever runs it. These tests read the pristine sv2v output and compare,
so a `make fetch-ibex` at a newer commit turns the suite red with a
message that says which port moved.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES **NOT** COVER, stated because a green check is only
as wide as what it examined and `docs/41` section 6.6 lists nine times
this repository has been bitten by that:

  * It examines `ibex_register_file_ff` synthesised ON ITS OWN, at
    soc_top.v's parameters. `docs/43` section 7 measures it inside
    `ibex_top` as well and reports a larger number there; the two are
    different quantities and neither supersedes the other.
  * It counts FLIP-FLOPS and asserts nothing about the other cells.
    The XOR trees are functional logic, not redundancy, so a mapper that
    restructured them would be doing its job.
  * It says nothing about placement, routing or timing. No block under
    `hw/soc/` has been through any of them.
  * It says nothing about whether the code is CORRECT. Two hundred and
    seventeen check flip-flops holding the wrong function are two
    hundred and seventeen check flip-flops.
    `hw/soc/formal/regfile_secded.sby` is where the code is proved.
  * It compares the port LIST and not the port MEANING. A port whose
    semantics changed upstream without its name changing is invisible
    to this and to the build, and `docs/43` section 3 names it as an
    accepted risk.

    syndrome tree hoisted past the read multiplexer -- 1.87 ns of the
    read path recovered for one parity tree per register -- and then
    declines it, because the SoC's 20 ns target is met with margin in
    both and eleven per cent of the core is the wrong thing to spend to
    widen a margin that is not binding.

    `docs/49` measured it again, through place-and-route, and DID NOT
    ADOPT IT either: it moves the sign-off worst slack by less than the
    instrument's own noise, because the path that binds at sign-off does
    not contain the syndrome tree. So the parameter is still a
    measurement and this is still the check that it stays one.

    liability `docs/43` section 12 item 5 names. Four flows may reach

    Icarus's `-P` reaches root modules only and a hierarchical path that
    names no root is discarded in silence. A whole-SoC run built that
    way is a run of the design WITHOUT the change, reported as a run
    with it -- which is `docs/41` section 6.6's shape in a simulator.

    `flow/sim_soc.sh` therefore reads the two arms of the SYNPRE
    generate out of the COMPILED OBJECT and fails if the wrong one is
    there. This is the check that it keeps doing so.

    the memory response register's two arms -- so what this test demands
    is that SYNPRE is one of the knobs it is applied to, not that the
    code is still shaped the way `docs/49` left it. A check that pinned
