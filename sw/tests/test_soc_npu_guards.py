"""Textual guards for the NPU connection.

These are the half of the checking that a simulation cannot do, and they
exist for the same reason `sw/tests/test_memmap.py` does: the cocotb
suite and the formal job check BEHAVIOUR, and neither can notice that a
constant has been copied instead of generated, that the frozen directory
has been written to, or that the design has grown a second copy of a
register map. Nothing here simulates anything.

The complementary half is stated in `docs/51-npu-integration.md` section
10, along with what neither half covers.
