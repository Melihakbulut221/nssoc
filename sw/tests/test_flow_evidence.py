"""Flow-evidence drift guard: docs/12 section 4 against the retained run tree.

ROADMAP gate G0 ("sg13g2 trial harden DRC/LVS clean") is claimed by
docs/12-sg13g2-flow-bringup.md section 4, whose numbers were read once,
by hand, out of a LibreLane run directory. Nothing re-read them
afterwards. This file does, mechanically, so that G0 is auditable rather
than merely asserted: it parses the numbers the document CLAIMS and
compares them with the artifacts the run actually LEFT BEHIND.

Same discipline as the two guards this repository already has:

  * sw/tests/test_regmap.py cross-checks the register tables in docs/10
    against the generated register map;
  * sw/tests/test_traceability.py ties every numbered spec equation to a
    test.

Nothing here hard-codes a sign-off number. Both sides are read at run
time - the document is the claim, ``final/metrics.json`` and the step
report files are the evidence - so a doc edit and an artifact change are
each caught on their own.

Two classes of test live here, and the split is deliberate:

  * document-only tests (no ``pytest.skip``). They hold on a fresh clone
    and check that the document still claims what G0 needs: every
    sign-off row still reads zero, the seven Netgen counters are still
    named, the stage arithmetic still adds up, the timing table still
    covers three corners with zero violations. Relaxing the claim now
    takes a conscious edit here.
  * artifact tests, which need the run tree. Run outputs are git-ignored
    (.gitignore, ``hw/openlane/*/runs/``), so on a fresh clone there is
    nothing to audit and those tests skip with the run tag, the path and
    the command that regenerates them. They must never fail merely for
    being run somewhere the tree was not kept.

The one artifact test that fails rather than skips is
``test_documented_run_tag_is_retained``: run trees present but not the
documented one is a document pointing at evidence that is not there, and
it would otherwise be a way to silence the whole audit by editing a
string. See its docstring for the trade-off that carries.

Regenerating the evidence, from the repository root::

    hw/openlane/run_trial.sh --design aer_fifo --run-tag g0gates2

*Corrected 2026-09-12: this said `--run-tag trial-03-signoff` for a day
after section 4 moved to `g0gates2`, which would have regenerated the
superseded run and then failed every test in this file against it. The
run tag the tests actually use is read out of the document by
`_run_tag()`; this line is the one place it was written twice.*

Scope: section 4 sign-off and provenance only - the DRC/LVS/antenna/
timing claims of 4.1 and 4.4, the run tag and stage count of the section
preamble, and the config that produced them. The area, cell-mix and
routing tables (4.2, 4.3, 4.6) are descriptive rather than gating and
are not guarded here.
