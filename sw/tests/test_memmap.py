"""SoC memory map consistency tests (single-source discipline).

The YAML source (regmap/memmap.yaml) must stay in sync with the six files
generated from it, and the map itself must satisfy the properties the
fabric's address decoder and Ibex's fixed vectors depend on. This is the
sibling of test_regmap.py and follows the same rule: the source is one
file, everything else is generated, and a stale generated file is a test
failure rather than something a reader has to notice.

The properties fall into four groups:

  1. Generation. The committed generated files match the YAML.
  2. Decodability. Every region is a naturally aligned power of two and
     no two overlap, so address decode is a prefix compare and never a
     magnitude comparison, and no address is claimed twice.
  3. Ibex reachability. docs/38-ibex-bringup.md section 7.5 defects 3 and
     4: the core resets to {boot_addr_i[31:8], 8'h80} and forces
     mtvec[7:2] to zero. A map that puts the reset vector or a trap
     vector where the core cannot reach it is wrong on arrival, and these
     tests are what make that a mechanical check rather than a comment.
  4. Cross-artifact agreement. The same address must appear identically
     in the Verilog header, the C header, the linker script, the device
     table contents and the documentation. Each of those is consumed by a
     different tool, so a generator that emitted them inconsistently
     would fail in five different places at five different times.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT COVER, stated because a green result here is
narrower than "the memory map works":

  * It does not simulate anything. That the RTL decodes what the map says
    is checked by hw/soc/tb/cocotb/test_soc_bus.py against the same
    generated constants, and end to end by hw/soc/flow/sim_soc.sh.
  * It does not check that a region's size is sensible, only that it is
    decodable. A 4 GiB RAM would pass every test here.
  * The RTL cross-check in test_fabric_decodes_every_ported_region is
    TEXTUAL. It confirms that soc_bus.v mentions the generated constants
    for each ported region and mentions no others; it cannot confirm that
    it uses them correctly. That is the formal job's F2, and the two are
    complementary: the formal proof cannot enumerate the map and this
    test cannot read the logic.
  * Nothing here says anything about the reserved regions beyond their
    addresses. Fourteen of the sixteen peripheral slots and six of the ten
    regions have no implementation at all.
