"""Synthesis guards: structures whose FUNCTION is to exist as separate
hardware must survive synthesis, and only the netlist can say whether
they survived SYNTHESIS.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT SAY, first because it has been read the other
way. A pass here is a statement about the NETLIST and not about the die.
`hw/openlane/replica_placement.py` and `sw/tests/test_replica_placement.py`
are the level below, and on the frozen sign-off layout they measure the
three banks this file counts as NOT placement-separated: 103 of the 165
configuration flip-flops have their nearest fellow in a different
replica. See `docs/79-replica-placement-and-equivalence.md`. This
docstring said "exist physically ... only the netlist can say", which is
where that reading came from; corrected 2026-09-09.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Until 2026-08-26 the configuration TMR domain of hw/rtl/pilot_top.v was
three `reg [54:0]` vectors written from the same expression on the same
cycle. yosys `opt_dff` normalised the three into identical enable
flip-flops and `opt_merge` then hashed them into one bank, so the voter
read a single physical register three times. The netlist that fed the
4x2 harden -- tt/runs/tt-harden/06-yosys-synthesis/ -- carries 362
references to `cfg_a[` and none at all to `cfg_b[` or `cfg_c[`.

The docs/16 fault-injection campaign injects at RTL level, where the
three vectors are still distinct signals, and reported the configuration
TMR as 15/15 CORRECTED. That measurement was true of the RTL and false
of the netlist. RTL simulation is structurally incapable of seeing a
structure that synthesis deletes, which is the gap these tests close.

Two traps this file is written to avoid
---------------------------------------
1. Never assert on a signal NAME. Marking the three replicas `(* keep *)`
   was measured on this design to leave the flip-flop count unchanged at
   1045 while filling the netlist with 110 references of the form
   `assign \\u_pilot.cfg_b[3] = \\u_pilot.cfg_a[3] ;` -- the wire name
   survives, the storage does not. Every assertion below counts
   flip-flop CELLS.
2. Never assert only on the structure that was fixed. A merge hazard is
   generic, so test_no_flip_flops_are_lost_to_optimisation compares the
   whole design's flip-flop population before and after optimisation and
   fails on ANY new loss, wherever it appears.
3. Never leave a bound where the design is already sitting on it. Added
   2026-08-27. The keep_hierarchy-stripped test used to allow one bank's
   worth of loss, and the design lost exactly one bank -- so the test
   passed while the property it was named for, three banks without the
   attribute, was false. A bound that a passing design touches is a
   bound that records the tool's behaviour, not the design's intent.
   That test now allows zero loss, and hw/rtl/pilot_top.v was changed to
   earn it. docs/20 section 11.

Running against a different RTL tree
------------------------------------
Set NSSOC_RTL_DIR to point the whole file at another copy of hw/rtl.
That is how the mutation check is run: restore the pre-fix pilot_top.v
in a scratch tree and confirm these tests fail.

# =====================================================================
# 1c. the show-ahead valid flag is two physical rails
# =====================================================================
# hw/rtl/pilot_top.v header section 8.2. docs/16 section 6.2 ranked the
# EVQ_OUT show-ahead adapter first for wave 6 because four of its six
# silent-corruption records sit in two one-bit valid flags, and this is
# the half of that pair which lives in pilot_top.v.
#
# It is TWO rails and not three replicas, and the reason is a proof
# rather than a budget. What holds replicas apart without depending on
# an attribute is that each stores a different FUNCTION of the value;
# over one bit there are exactly two such functions, x and ~x. Two
# rails take one each and are provably non-collidable. A third has
# nothing left to take. The configuration domain measured the same
# bound at 55 bits (test_config_tmr_survives_a_flow_that_ignores_
# keep_hierarchy) and escaped it with the MIX layer, which needs at
# least four bits and so does not exist here.
#
# Two rails detect and do not correct. That is a design decision
# recorded in the RTL, not something this file can check; what this
# file checks is that the second rail is physically there, because a
# merged pair is a single flip-flop that agrees with itself and
# reports nothing -- and, unlike the configuration collapse, it is
# invisible to simulation in BOTH directions, since two rails that
# store the same function never disagree in RTL either.
#
# These three tests strip keep_hierarchy and leave `(* keep *)` on the
# storage, so what they measure is POL plus one hint. Section 1e below
# deletes the text of both attributes and measures POL alone, and
# docs/33-rail-transform.md records what POL does and does not reach.
#
# Mutation-checked 2026-08-30 [fact]: with `.POL(1'b1)` on u_ohv_b
# changed to `.POL(1'b0)` -- functionally identical RTL, no simulation
# can tell -- the ECP5 attribute-free census reads u_ohv_a 0 and
# u_ohv_b 1, and the ASIC total goes 1274 -> 1273, so
# test_show_ahead_valid_is_two_rails_without_keep_hierarchy_in_ecp5 and
# test_config_tmr_survives_a_flow_that_ignores_keep_hierarchy both fail
# and nothing else in this file does.
# Extended 2026-08-30 to the other two flags of the same class, on the
# same construction and with the same mutation check: the queues'
# registered read-valid (hw/rtl/aer_fifo.v, u_rdv_a / u_rdv_b, one pair
# per queue INSTANCE and therefore four rails in the pilot) and the
# neuron core's output holding flag (hw/rtl/lif_core.v, u_op_a /
# u_op_b). Each of the three files carries its own six-line rail module
# rather than sharing one: aer_fifo.v must elaborate alone for
# formal/aer_fifo.sby and hw/tb/Makefile, and lif_core.v cannot
# instantiate a module declared in its own parent. The duplication is
# deliberate and each module's header says so.

# =====================================================================
# 1e. the storage transform with no attribute in the sources at all
# =====================================================================
# Everything above this line asks the attribute-free question with
# `attrmap -modattr -remove keep_hierarchy`, which deletes the module
# attribute and leaves `(* keep *)` on the storage. That is one of the
# two hints, so those tests measure POL plus `keep`, not POL. The three
# rail headers claim POL alone, on its own, with no attribute honoured
# by anybody -- and a claim the suite cannot fail is a claim nothing is
# holding.
#
# These tests delete BOTH attributes from the text of the sources before
# yosys reads them, so no pass can honour what is not there, and then
# ask the question two ways:
#
#   design-wide   the whole design's flip-flop population must be
#                 unchanged from the attributed build. A merged rail is
#                 exactly one lost flip-flop, a merged bank is 55 or 3.
#   rail-local    each rail module alone, in a two-instance harness, must
#                 map to two flip-flops. This is asked separately because
#                 with keep_hierarchy absent from the SOURCE the instance
#                 path is gone from the cell names as well, so
#                 Census.in_instance has nothing to count and the
#                 design-wide total is the only design-wide evidence
#                 available.
#
# Measured 2026-08-31 [fact]: 1296 flip-flops with the attributes and
# 1296 without, in both recipes, and two flip-flops per harness.
#
# Mutation-checked 2026-08-31, twice, because the two tests answer to
# different mutations and each would pass the other's [fact]:
#
#   .POL(1'b1) -> .POL(1'b0) on the u_ohv_b INSTANTIATION, functionally
#   identical RTL that no simulation in this repository can tell from
#   the original: both design-wide totals go to 1295 and
#   test_no_flip_flop_is_lost_when_every_attribute_is_deleted fails. The
#   harnesses pass, and correctly so -- they parameterise the module
#   themselves, so they are asking about pilot_flag_rail and not about
#   how pilot_top happens to have wired it.
#
#   `bits <= d ^ POL` / `q = bits ^ POL` reduced to `bits <= d` /
#   `q = bits` inside pilot_flag_rail, which is the transform deleted at
#   the source: the pilot harness maps to one flip-flop and
#   test_a_rail_pair_is_two_flip_flops_with_no_attribute_at_all fails.
#
# What these tests do NOT show, and the reason docs/33-rail-transform.md
# exists: POL is erased between synthesis and silicon. The stored reset
# value is `1'b0 ^ POL`, sg13g2 gives dfflibmap no asynchronous flip-flop
# that resets to 1 (it prints `unmapped dff cell: $_DFF_PN1_`), so
# dfflibmap builds the POL=1 rail by inverting D and Q around
# sg13g2_dfrbpq and abc folds those inverters against the rail's own
# `d ^ POL` and `bits ^ POL`. In the sign-off netlist both rails are a
# plain reset-to-0 flip-flop storing the flag true, with buffers and no
# inverter -- which is safe, because dfflibmap runs after the last merge
# pass this flow performs, and which is why
# test_the_shipped_netlist_holds_one_flip_flop_per_rail below counts the
# artifact rather than trusting the model.

    History, because the bound here moved and the reason matters. This
    test used to allow `lost <= TMR_W`, one bank, on the reasoning that
    POL polarity coding separates A from B and C was a bonus. That bound
    was correct and the design sat exactly on it: measured 2026-08-26 on
    pinned sources, 1,155 -> 1,100, replica C entirely merged away. A
    storage bit has two polarities and there are three replicas, so no
    choice of CFG_POL_C could have done better. `MIX = 1` on replica C
    (hw/rtl/pilot_top.v, pilot_cfg_bank) makes each of its stored bits an
    XOR of two or three configuration bits, which no per-bit hash can
    match against x_i or ~x_i, and the loss went to zero. The tight bound
    is the point of the test: at `<= TMR_W` this file would have passed
    just as happily with the third bank gone.

    Self-calibrating against the intact run, so growing the design does
    not need this number edited.

    Both replicated domains are inside this number. The configuration
    banks are 55 flip-flops each and the twelve AER pointer banks are
    PTR_W each, so a loss that is a multiple of 55 points at
    hw/rtl/pilot_top.v and a small loss at hw/rtl/aer_fifo.v; either way

    with itself while the shipped flow does something else. Only the
    final netlist is the artifact that becomes silicon.

    This does NOT duplicate Checker.YosysUnmappedCells. That checker
    fails when the $paramod module types reach the mapped netlist, which
    is the crash this design's SYNTH_HIERARCHY_MODE setting avoids; a
    run that reaches final/ has already passed it. What no checker looks
    at is whether the three banks are still three banks, which is the
    property the design needs and the one measured here.

    Skips when no such run is on disk: the hardening is not part of the
    test suite's own work, so this reports on the latest one a developer
    or CI happened to leave behind.

# on this repository, hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/tr-control postdates the
# edit that introduced aer_par_bank, was hardened from a tree that did
# not contain it, and was therefore accepted as a witness and reported a
# missing check field as a collapse [fact]. Same failure would hit the
# pointer and rail guards the moment anyone hardens an older tree.

# module names the ELABORATED design contained -- written before any
# optimisation pass runs, so it records what synthesis was handed and not
# what it did. A run whose header does not name the module was not built
