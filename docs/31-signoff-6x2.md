# 31 — The geometric sign-off of the adopted configuration, and the configuration the shuttle would actually build

Status: complete. Two hardens at the 6x2 submission shape, pinned to
`bc91c71`. The adopted timing configuration passes every sign-off deck —
Magic DRC, KLayout DRC, the KLayout XOR, Netgen LVS, antenna, and setup
and hold on all three corners with a real 5 % OCV derate — and the
configuration the shuttle would actually build from **misses its slow
corner and would not say so**. Section 8 is the verdict.

This document does two things. It runs `docs/28` section 10 item 7 to
completion — the three geometric decks the adopted timing configuration
had never had read — on the **current** RTL rather than on the RTL
`docs/28` hardened, which has moved twice since. And it answers a
question `docs/28` section 10 item 2 raised and did not close: whether
any of the recovery is in the configuration the shuttle would actually
build from.

**The short version.**

- **None of the adopted settings are in the submission path.** Not one
  of the six keys — the derate fix, the setup-corner fix, and the four
  keys of `docs/28` section 6.2 — appears in `tt/src/config.json`,
  `tt/src/config_merged.json` or `tt/src/user_config.json`. Section 2.1.
- **Hardened, the submission path misses its slow corner.** Same RTL,
  same shape, same pin commit, run from `tt/src/`'s own configuration:
  **-0.7696 ns and 18 violating endpoints as the flow reports it,
  -1.8321 ns derated** — and the flow would have called that run clean,
  because with `SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS` unset the setup checker looks
  at the typical corner, which passes at +6.8753. **The adopted
  configuration is worth 3.0588 ns on this RTL, and the shuttle would
  take none of it.** Section 2.2.
- **The configuration signs off clean on the current RTL under the
  stricter definition.** Slow-corner setup **+1.2262 ns with a real 5 %
  OCV derate applied inside the flow**, 0 setup and 0 hold violations on
  all three corners with the setup checker pointed at all three.
  Section 4.
- **Applying the derate inside the loop bought margin rather than
  costing it.** The post-GRT resizer entered at -1.973 ns instead of
  -0.956 ns, worked 46 endpoints instead of 39, resized 49 gates instead
  of 11 — and the run finishes **+0.4752 ns better than `tr-margin` did
  derated**, while carrying 19 more flip-flops. Section 5.
- **Every geometric deck is zero, on current RTL.** Magic DRC 0,
  KLayout DRC 0, **KLayout XOR 0 — never run in this repository
  before** — Netgen LVS 0 on all four unmatched counters, antenna 0,
  route DRC 0, `flow__errors__count` 0. Section 4.2.
- **All five shipped-netlist guards pass by name, none skipping.**
  35 passed, 0 skipped, against 33 passed and 2 skipped before this
  run. Section 7.
- **The tile budget is comfortable**: 48.75 % utilization against a
  70 % criterion at twelve tiles, 201,400 um2 of core unoccupied.
  Section 6.
- **It is not submittable as it stands.** The design closes; the
  submission does not carry what makes it close. Section 8.

## 1. What was run, and against which sources

### 1.1 Toolchain

```
$ make -f tools.mk toolcheck
OSS_CAD_SUITE = /home/hasanmelih/Downloads/oss-cad-suite-linux-x64-20260804/oss-cad-suite
sby       = .../bin/sby
yosys     = .../bin/yosys
iverilog  = .../bin/iverilog
yosys version = 0.67+146 (pinned 0.67+146)
```

No mismatch warning **[fact]**.

| Component | Version | Where it is pinned |
|---|---|---|
| LibreLane | 3.0.5 | `~/Documents/caravel-lif-crossbar/.venv-flow` |
| Yosys (in-flow) | 0.67 | LibreLane wheel (`pyosys`) |
| Yosys (guards, `tools.mk`) | 0.67+146 | `OSS_CAD_SUITE` pin |
| ihp-sg13g2 PDK | `c4b8b4e5e7a05f375cca3815d51b3a37721fbf5c` | LibreLane `pdk_hashes.yaml`, asserted by `run_ihp.sh` |
| Magic | 8.3.678 | `~/.local/opt/magic-8.3.678` |
| OpenSTA (the derate and Fmax probes) | the `~/.local/opt/llbin/sta` shim | same OpenROAD build the flow uses |

**[fact]**, read out of `hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/signoff-6x2/resolved.json`
and `librelane --version`.

### 1.2 Provenance: the blob list

Both runs are pinned with `hw/openlane/pin_rtl.py` against commit
**`bc91c71`** (HEAD when this work started, tree clean) and read a
disposable snapshot by absolute path, not `hw/rtl`:

```
$ python3 hw/openlane/pin_rtl.py bc91c71 \
      hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/config.signoff-6x2.json <scratch>/pin-signoff-6x2

```

**[fact]**, and the same ten blobs for `subpath-6x2`.

**The RTL has moved twice since `docs/28`.** Against `c52518e`, which
`docs/28` hardened, two blobs differ:

| File | `c52518e` | `bc91c71` | What moved |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hw/rtl/aer_fifo.v` | `70045ec25774` | `ba4e5b0d2e0c` | `docs/29`: queue entry parity (`aer_par_bank`) |
| `hw/rtl/pilot_top.v` | `3d9f84047748` | `873b57d3572b` | `docs/30`: `par_err` counter, dispatcher check field (`pilot_chk_bank`) |

**[fact, `git rev-parse <commit>:hw/rtl/<file>`]**. The other eight blobs
are byte-identical. So every number in `docs/28` section 6.3 is a number
about RTL that no longer exists, and re-reading its run directory would
not have closed the gap even though the decks in it did pass — section
5.1 quotes them for comparison and does not adopt them.

**The seven files the run synthesized** are the `VERILOG_FILES` list:
`tt_um_melihakbulut_nssoc.v`, `pilot_top.v`, `lif_core.v`, `aer_fifo.v`,
`tmr_voter.v`, `secded_enc.v`, `secded_dec.v`, plus `npu_regs.vh` as an
include. `npu_regbank.v` and `scrub.v` are materialised by the pin
script — it copies the whole of `hw/rtl` — and are not in the file list,
so they are not synthesized **[fact, `06-yosys-synthesis/config.json`]**.
`tt/src/*.v` carries byte-identical blobs to `hw/rtl/*.v` for all seven
sources and the include **[fact, `git hash-object` on both trees]**, so
the run and the submission tree agree on the RTL. They do not agree on
the configuration, which is section 2.

### 1.3 The two runs

| Tag | Configuration | Purpose | To |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`signoff-6x2`** | `config.signoff-6x2.json` | the adopted configuration, full sign-off | end of flow |
| `subpath-6x2` | `config.6x2.json` | **what the submission path builds**: no derate, no setup-corner fix, no post-GRT repair | `OpenROAD.STAPostPNR` |

Both at the 6x2 submission shape, `CLOCK_PERIOD: 20`,
`SYNTH_HIERARCHY_MODE: deferred_flatten`,
`DIE_AREA 0 0 1289.28 313.74`, `FP_DEF_TEMPLATE
tt_block_6x2_pgvdd.def`, pinned to `bc91c71`.

`config.signoff-6x2.json` is generated by
`hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/mktiming.py`, which `--check` re-derives and
diffs, and it is derived from **`config.json` and not from
`config.6x2.json`**. That distinction is the whole reason the run means
what it means, and section 3 is why.

Exact commands:

```bash
make -f tools.mk toolcheck
python3 hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/mktiming.py            # write the variants
python3 hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/mktiming.py --check    # confirm no drift

python3 hw/openlane/pin_rtl.py bc91c71 \
    hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/config.signoff-6x2.json <scratch>/pin-signoff-6x2

mkdir -p hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/signoff-6x2
CONFIG=<scratch>/pin-signoff-6x2/config.json \
  hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/run_ihp.sh \
    --run-tag signoff-6x2 \
    --force-run-dir $PWD/hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/signoff-6x2

python3 hw/openlane/signoff_report.py hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/signoff-6x2
```

## 2. The recovery settings are not in the submission path

This is the finding that outranks every number in this document, so it
is stated before them.

### 2.1 The audit

Six keys are at issue: the two flow-defect fixes of `docs/28` section
4.4, and the four keys of the adopted configuration in `docs/28` section
6.2. Searched across the submission tree and this repository's own
configs **[fact, textual search of each file]**:

| Key | `tt/src/config.json` | `tt/src/config_merged.json` | `tt/src/user_config.json` | `pilot_ihp/config.json` | `config.tr-margin.json` | `config.signoff-6x2.json` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT` (float) | **absent** | **absent** | **absent** | present | **absent** | present |
| `SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS` | **absent** | **absent** | **absent** | present | present | present |
| `PNR_CORNERS` | **absent** | **absent** | **absent** | **absent** | present | present |
| `RUN_POST_GRT_DESIGN_REPAIR` | **absent** | **absent** | **absent** | **absent** | present | present |
| `RUN_POST_GRT_RESIZER_TIMING` | **absent** | **absent** | **absent** | **absent** | present | present |
| `GRT_RESIZER_SETUP_SLACK_MARGIN` | **absent** | **absent** | **absent** | **absent** | present | present |

**Not one of the six keys is in the submission path.** `docs/28` section
10 item 2 recorded this for `SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS` alone; it is true
of all six.

**Said plainly: if the shuttle built from `tt/src/` as it stands today,
it would build without any of the margin the recovery bought, without
the derate, and with the setup checker gating the typical corner only.**
The GDS action reads `tt/src/config.json`; nothing in `hw/openlane/`
reaches it.

### 2.2 What that costs, measured rather than argued

`subpath-6x2` hardens the **same RTL, same shape, same pin commit**
from `config.6x2.json`, which is `mkconfig.py`'s mechanical derivation
of `tt/src/config_merged.json` and carries none of the six keys
**[fact, `resolved.json`: `SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS` unset,
`PNR_CORNERS` unset, `RUN_POST_GRT_RESIZER_TIMING: False`, and
`_env.tcl` `set ::env(TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT) 5`]**. It is the
submission path, run.

`55-openroad-stapostpnr`, extracted parasitics **[fact]**:

| Corner | `subpath-6x2` setup ws | Setup violations | Setup TNS | `signoff-6x2` setup ws |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **`nom_slow_1p08V_125C`** | **-0.7696** | **18** | **-8.9932** | **+1.2262** |
| `nom_typ_1p20V_25C` | +6.8753 | 0 | 0.0000 | +8.1033 |
| `nom_fast_1p32V_m40C` | +11.4244 | 0 | 0.0000 | +12.1374 |

Hold closes on both runs at every corner, 0 violations
(`subpath-6x2` slow hold +0.6148) **[fact]**.

**The submission path does not close 50 MHz on the current RTL.** It
misses the slow corner by **-0.7696 ns as the flow reports it**, on
**18 violating endpoints**, and by **-1.8321 ns** with the 5 % OCV
derate applied — measured by standalone OpenSTA on the run's own
netlist, SPEF and SDC, with the same probe that reproduces
`tt/runs/wave6-6x2`'s figures to seventeen digits **[fact:
un-derated `-0.769622609648127`, derated `-1.832068770768804`]**.

**And nothing in that run would have said so.** With
`SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS` unset, `Checker.SetupViolations` resolves to
the PDK's `TIMING_VIOLATION_CORNERS: ["*typ*"]` and examines the typical
corner, which is clean at +6.8753. `docs/29` section 4.1 already
demonstrated this once — a run that reached `Magic.DRC` with
`flow__errors__count` clean while carrying 14 slow-corner setup
violations. On current RTL the figure is **18** **[fact, the
violation count above; that the checker would pass is an
`[estimate]`, since this run was stopped at `OpenROAD.STAPostPNR`
before the checkers, but it follows from the resolved corner list and
from `docs/29`'s measurement of the same configuration]**.

**So the adopted configuration is worth 3.0588 ns on this RTL**
(+1.2262 against -1.8321, both derated), and the shuttle as configured
today would take none of it.

### 2.3 Two further things the table shows

**`config.tr-margin.json` — the file `docs/28` names as carrying the
adopted configuration — does not carry the derate fix.** It was
generated by `mktiming.py` from `config.6x2.json` before commit
`4dabcbf` added `TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT: 5.0` to `config.json`, and
`config.6x2.json` was never regenerated. Re-running `tr-margin` today
would still harden with the derate silently integer-divided to zero.
The adopted configuration is therefore **split across two files that
were never merged**, and `config.signoff-6x2.json` is the first file in
this repository that holds all six keys at once. `mktiming.py` now
asserts both fixes are present in its base and exits rather than
generating a variant without them.

**`mkconfig.py --check` reports `config.json` as drifted** **[fact,
exit 1, `DRIFT: hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/config.json`]**. The two fixes
were hand-added to a file whose header says
`GENERATED by mkconfig.py ... Do not hand-edit; re-run the script.`
Anyone re-running `mkconfig.py` regenerates it from
`tt/src/config_merged.json`, which carries neither key, and silently
removes both fixes. That is not a hypothetical: it is the same class of
defect as the two `docs/28` reported, a correct setting that a tool
quietly reverts.

### 2.4 Why `tt/src/config.json` was not edited here

The commissioning of this work permitted editing `tt/src/config.json`
if the settings were found missing. They are missing, and the edit was
still not made, because **it does not fix the submission path and the
repository rejects it.** Measured:

- `tt/src/config.json` is **generated**. `scripts/gen_tt_submission.py`
  builds it from a verbatim upstream template plus a `CONFIG_OVERRIDES`
  dictionary that currently holds one entry,
  `SYNTH_HIERARCHY_MODE: deferred_flatten` **[fact, lines 233-235 and
  1632-1644]**.
- With the two fixes hand-added to `tt/src/config.json`,
  `python3 scripts/gen_tt_submission.py --check` reports
  **`differs from the generator: tt/src/config.json`** and instructs the
  reader to run the generator, which reverts the edit **[fact, measured
  and then reverted; the tree is unchanged]**.
- `sw/tests/test_tt_submission.py` gates the same property through
  `tt/MANIFEST.sha256` and `test_tree_matches_the_generator`. It passes
  today, 16 passed **[fact]**, and a hand edit fails it.

So a hand edit produces a submission config that is correct, fails the
repository's own drift gate, and is undone by the next generator run.
**The change that actually closes this is one entry in
`CONFIG_OVERRIDES` in `scripts/gen_tt_submission.py` followed by
`python3 scripts/gen_tt_submission.py`**, and `scripts/` is not this
workstream's file. Section 8 states it as the blocking item.

---

## 3. The configuration that was hardened

### 3.1 The six keys

```json
"TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT": 5.0,
"SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS": ["*"],
"PNR_CORNERS": ["nom_typ_1p20V_25C", "nom_slow_1p08V_125C"],
"RUN_POST_GRT_DESIGN_REPAIR": 1,
"RUN_POST_GRT_RESIZER_TIMING": 1,
"GRT_RESIZER_SETUP_SLACK_MARGIN": 0.5
```

plus `RUN_KLAYOUT_DRC: 1` and `RUN_KLAYOUT_XOR: 1`, which are read-only
decks over the streamed GDS and move no layout bit. Everything else,
including `CLOCK_PERIOD`, `PL_TARGET_DENSITY_PCT`, `DIE_AREA` and
`SYNTH_HIERARCHY_MODE`, is the submission's own value.

**`PL_TIMING_DRIVEN` is deliberately not set.** `docs/28` section 5.5
measures it at +0.5856 ns with negative area cost, and section 10 item 9
names its composition with the post-GRT repair as the one experiment
`docs/28` did not run. It is not adopted here for the same reason
`docs/28` did not adopt it: this document does not ship a knob it has
not hardened, and the run below closes without it. Confirmed off in the
run: `PL_TIMING_DRIVEN: False` **[fact, `resolved.json`]**.

Nothing was tuned. The four timing keys are `docs/28` section 6.2
verbatim, and no knob was moved after a number was read.

### 3.2 The derate really is applied, and `resolved.json` cannot tell you

`docs/28` section 4.4(b) established that the PDK ships
`TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT` as the integer `5` and that LibreLane's
`base.sdc` consumes it with Tcl integer division, so `expr 5 / 100` is
`0` and the derate factors are `1.0` and `1.0` while the log prints
"Setting timing derate to: 5%". Writing it as a float makes the division
real.

**The proof, at every level the value passes through [fact]:**

| Evidence | `tr-margin` (docs/28) | **`signoff-6x2`** |
|---|---|---|
| `resolved.json` | `"TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT": 5` | `"TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT": 5` |
| Step `_env.tcl` | `set ::env(TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT) 5` | **`... 5.0`** |
| Flow log line | `Setting timing derate to: 5%` | **`... 5.0%`** |
| **Flow-written SDC** | **no `set_timing_derate` line at all** | **`set_timing_derate -early 0.9500` / `-late 1.0500`** |
| `tclsh`: `expr 1+[expr $v / 100]` | `1` | **`1.05`** |

The written SDC is the artifact that decides, and it carries the derate
in `signoff-6x2` and does not exist in `tr-margin`.

**`resolved.json` is lossy for this key and must not be used to audit
it.** It records `5` in both runs — the float is flattened on
serialization — while `_env.tcl`, which is what Tcl actually reads,
records `5` and `5.0` respectively. Anyone verifying whether a run in
this repository derated must read `_env.tcl` or the written SDC, never
`resolved.json`. That is a third instance of the shape `docs/23` section
3.2 and `docs/28` section 4.4(a) name: a record that looks like evidence
and is not.

*Extended 2026-09-06 by `docs/72-post-grt-resizer.md` section 7.1: a
step directory's own `config.json` is lossy in the same way — it records
`5` for a flow that derated at `5.0` — so `python -m librelane.steps
run` on a step's own `config.json` and `state_in.json` re-runs that
step with no derate, silently. Measured at the post-GRT resizer's
iteration 0: 1.744 ns and 1.623 ns better than the flow on the same
ODB, same libraries and same global route. The copy handed to the
runner must be corrected to `5.0` by hand.*

### 3.3 The setup checker is pointed at all three corners

`SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS: ["*"]` against the PDK's
`TIMING_VIOLATION_CORNERS: ["*typ*"]` **[fact, `resolved.json`]**. So a
negative slow corner fails this run, where in every run before `docs/28`
it would have been invisible. Section 4's zero setup-violation count
therefore means something it did not mean in `docs/15` through
`docs/27`.

---

## 4. Sign-off

`hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/signoff-6x2`, ihp-sg13g2, 6x2, pinned to
`bc91c71`, LibreLane 3.0.5.

### 4.1 Timing, all three corners, derated

`57-openroad-stapostpnr`, post-PnR STA on extracted parasitics, **with
the 5 % OCV derate applied by the flow** (section 3.2), all figures in
ns **[fact]**:

| Corner | Setup ws | Setup vio | Hold ws | Hold vio | Max slew vio | Max cap vio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `nom_slow_1p08V_125C` | **+1.2262** | **0** | **+0.6041** | **0** | 0 | 0 |
| `nom_typ_1p20V_25C` | +8.1033 | 0 | +0.2829 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `nom_fast_1p32V_m40C` | +12.1374 | 0 | +0.1029 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Corroborated three ways rather than from the worst-slack metric alone
**[fact]**: `summary.rpt` reports setup TNS and hold TNS **0.0000 at
every corner** and violation counts 0; `design__violations` is 0 and
`flow__errors__count` is 0; and `Checker.SetupViolations` — pointed at
`["*"]`, not at typical — passed.

**Fmax, derated.** A period sweep on the shipped netlist and parasitics
is exactly linear: 19.0 / 19.5 / 20.0 / 20.5 / 21.0 ns give
+0.2262 / +0.7262 / +1.2262 / +1.7262 / +2.2262 ns, i.e. 1 ns of period
buys 1.0000 ns of slack **[fact, standalone OpenSTA]**. So the longest
path is **18.7738 ns** and Fmax is **53.27 MHz**, derated. The design
runs at 50 MHz with **+1.2262 ns, 6.13 % of the cycle, of real OCV
margin.**

### 4.2 The complete sign-off set

Read with `python3 hw/openlane/signoff_report.py
hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/signoff-6x2` off `final/metrics.json`, so
`tr-margin` and this run are read the same way **[fact]**. Step numbers
are `signoff-6x2`'s; `tr-margin` numbers its steps two lower, having no
XOR pair:

| Deck / checker | Step | `tr-margin` (`docs/28`) | **`signoff-6x2`** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Magic DRC** | `67-magic-drc`, `69-checker-magicdrc` | 0 | **0 — passed** |
| **KLayout DRC** | `68-klayout-drc`, `70-checker-klayoutdrc` | 0 | **0 — passed** |
| **KLayout XOR** | `65-klayout-xor`, `66-checker-xor` | **not run** | **0 — passed** |
| **Netgen LVS** | `73-netgen-lvs`, `74-checker-lvs` | 0 | **0 — passed** |
| LVS unmatched nets | | 0 | **0** |
| LVS unmatched devices | | 0 | **0** |
| LVS unmatched pins | | 0 | **0** |
| LVS property fails | | 0 | **0** |
| Illegal overlap | `72-checker-illegaloverlap` | pass | **passed** |
| Route DRC | `49-checker-trdrc` | 0 | **0 — passed** |
| **Antenna**, final | `48-openroad-checkantennas-1` | 0 nets | **0 nets, 0 pins** |
| Antenna diodes inserted | | 8 | **1** |
| Power-grid violations | `30-checker-powergridviolations` | 0 | **0 — passed** |
| Disconnected pins | `51-checker-disconnectedpins` | 6 | **6, 0 critical — passed** |
| Wirelength checker | `53-checker-wirelength` | pass | **passed** |
| **Setup violations, all corners** | `75-checker-setupviolations` | 0 | **0 — passed** |
| **Hold violations, all corners** | `76-checker-holdviolations` | 0 | **0 — passed** |
| Max slew / max cap, all corners | `77`, `78` | 0 / 0 | **0 / 0 — passed** |
| Lint / synth checks / unmapped cells / netlist assigns | `02`-`04`, `07`-`09` | pass | **all passed** |
| `design__violations` | | 0 | **0** |
| **`flow__errors__count`** | | 0 | **0** |

**The three geometric decks that `docs/28` section 10 item 7 left
unread are read, and all three are zero.** The KLayout XOR is new: it
has never been run in this repository before, and it reports **0
differing geometry between the Magic and KLayout GDS streams**, which
is the deck the Tiny Tapeout precheck runs and the one whose failure
would have cost a resubmission round.

**The two `[fact]`s that need a caveat.**

**The 6 disconnected pins are deliberate**, not a defect: `ena`,
`ui_in[7]` and `uio_in[4]` through `uio_in[7]`, all unused inputs of
the Tiny Tapeout wrapper. `design__critical_disconnected_pin__count`
is **0** and `Checker.DisconnectedPins` passed **[fact,
`50-odb-reportdisconnectedpins/full_disconnected_pins_table.txt`]**.

**84 max-fanout violations are reported at the slow corner, and no
checker in this flow gates them.** The flow has
`Checker.MaxSlewViolations` and `Checker.MaxCapViolations` and no
max-fanout equivalent **[fact, the step list]**. The figure is **84 on
`signoff-6x2`, 84 on `tr-margin` and 84 on `subpath-6x2`** — stable
across configurations and RTL waves, so it is not a regression, but it
is the same shape of gap `docs/23` section 3.2 and `docs/28` section
4.4(a) name and it is recorded here rather than left in a metrics file.
It is item 3 of section 8.

Runtime: **45.9 min of summed step time over 78 steps**, against
`tr-margin`'s 136.2 min. Magic DRC is **35 min 30 s** of it and detailed
routing 4 min 24 s **[fact, `runtime.txt` files]**. The difference
against `tr-margin` is machine contention rather than the design:
`docs/28`'s five hardens shared twenty cores and its Magic DRC alone
took 1 h 43 m.

**One thing about this run directory a reproducer needs to know.** The
flow was executed in three passes. Two were terminated by process-group
signals from the harness driving them — not by the flow, which logged no
error — and each was resumed with `--from`, at `Magic.WriteLEF` and then
at `Magic.DRC`. The consequence visible on disk is a **duplicate
`62-magic-writelef` orphaned beside the `63-magic-writelef` that the
resumed flow actually used**. The step chain is nonetheless coherent:
both `64-odb-checkdesignantennaproperties` and `67-magic-drc` read their
DEF from `55-odb-cellfrequencytables`, the single routed database, and
every deck above ran against it **[fact, `state_in.json` of each]**. An
uninterrupted run produces the same numbers with one fewer directory;
nothing in the sign-off set depends on the interruption.

### 4.3 The redundancy census on the shipped netlist

`RSZ_DONT_TOUCH_RX` is `$^` and matches nothing **[fact,
`resolved.json`]**, so the post-GRT resizer was free to resize, clone or
unbuffer a rail or a replica. It resized 49 combinational gates and
inserted 20 buffers. Counted by hand on
`54-openroad-fillinsertion/tt_um_melihakbulut_nssoc.nl.v`, the netlist
`57-openroad-stapostpnr` signed off **[fact]**:

| Structure | Expected | Found | |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total mapped flip-flops | 1,296 | **1,296** | matches `docs/30` section 4.3 exactly |
| Configuration TMR, `u_cfg_a/b/c` | 55 each, 3 banks | **55 / 55 / 55** | pass |
| AER pointer TMR | 3 each, 12 banks | **3 in all twelve** | pass |
| Queue entry parity, `u_evq_*.u_par` | 4 each, 2 banks | **4 / 4** | pass |
| Dispatcher check field, `u_disp_chk` | 2 | **2** | pass |
| Valid-flag rails | `u_ohv_a/b` 1, `u_rdv_a/b` 2, `u_op_a/b` 1 | **1 / 1 / 2 / 2 / 1 / 1** | pass |

**No sequential cell was touched.** The same census on
`subpath-6x2`'s final netlist gives the same twenty-six numbers
**[fact]**, so the structures survive both configurations.

---

## 5. What the numbers mean

### 5.1 The margin is better than the adopted configuration's own, on more RTL

Slow-corner setup slack at 20 ns, slow corner, **all rows derated so
they are comparable**:

| Run | RTL | Configuration | Slow setup, derated |
|---|---|---|---:|
| `tt/runs/wave6-6x2` (`docs/27`) | `c52518e` | submission, pre-recovery | **-0.6681** |
| **`runs/subpath-6x2`** | **`bc91c71`** | **the submission path today** | **-1.8321** |
| `runs/tr-margin` (`docs/28` adopted) | `c52518e` | tr-margin, derate **not** applied in-flow | **+0.7510** |
| `trbest_parity` (`docs/29`) | `634ca3e` | `tr-best` (`DELAY 0`) | +0.4306 |
| `w8_disp_chk2` (`docs/30`) | wave 8 | `tr-best` (`DELAY 0`) | +1.0423 |
| **`runs/signoff-6x2`** | **`bc91c71`** | **adopted + derate in-flow** | **+1.2262** |

**[fact]**, measured in this workstream, for the `wave6-6x2`,
`subpath-6x2`, `tr-margin` and `signoff-6x2` rows. The `trbest_parity`
and `w8_disp_chk2` rows are **quoted** from `docs/29` section 4.2 and
`docs/30` section 6.2; their run trees were placed outside the
repository and are no longer on disk, which is independently visible in
that the provenance-gated guards skip without them **[fact]**.

Two of the four measured rows are reproductions rather than new
readings, and they are what validate the probe before it is used on
anything new **[fact, standalone OpenSTA on each run's own netlist,
SPEF and SDC]**:

- `wave6-6x2`: un-derated **`0.32288661547280123`**, reproducing that
  run's own `timing__setup__ws__corner` metric to all 17 digits, and
  derated **`-0.6681198006172618`**, reproducing `docs/28` section 7.
- `tr-margin`: derated **`0.7509779677344754`**, reproducing `docs/28`
  section 7's +0.7510.

**The adopted configuration, with the derate live inside the flow,
signs off +0.4752 ns better than it did with the derate absent — while
carrying 19 more flip-flops from two RTL waves.**

### 5.2 Why applying the derate bought margin instead of costing it

The derate is not only a reporting change. `PNR_CORNERS` puts the slow
corner inside the PnR loop, so once the derate is real the post-GRT
resizer optimises against a corner that is 1 ns harsher, and it responds
by working proportionally harder. Post-GRT resizer, same step, same
knob, **[fact,
`44-openroad-resizertimingpostgrt/*.log` of each run]**:

| | `tr-margin` (no derate) | **`signoff-6x2`** (derated) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Endpoints found with setup violations | 39 | **46** |
| Slack entering | -0.956 | **-1.973** |
| Slack leaving | +0.578 | **+0.519** |
| Gates resized | 11 | **49** |
| Buffers inserted | 7 | **20** |
| Pin swaps | 6 | **13** |
| Area growth reported by the resizer | +0.1 % | **+0.2 %** |

The resizer entered 1.017 ns worse — almost exactly the 0.9910 ns
`docs/28` section 4.4(b) measured the derate to be worth — and still
left at +0.519 ns against its 0.5 ns target, having spent 0.2 % of area
instead of 0.1 %. **The derate was not a tax on the result; it was
better information for the only step in this flow that repairs setup.**
That is a `[fact]` for the two columns and an `[estimate]` for the
attribution, since the RTL also moved between the two runs.

**The critical cone has swapped back.** `docs/28` section 3.1's central
finding was a cone swap: `docs/23`'s critical path started at
`u_pilot.u_lif.jj[1]`, and wave 6's started at
`u_pilot.u_lif.ev_axon_r[1]`. On this run the worst path launches from
**`u_pilot.u_lif.jj[0]`** again, and its endpoint,
`u_pilot.u_lif._5559_`, is exactly the endpoint the post-GRT resizer
reported as its worst throughout its 120 iterations **[fact,
`max.rpt` and `44-openroad-resizertimingpostgrt/*.log`]**. Both cones
are the same single-cycle neuron update `docs/28` section 3.2 names, so
this is a re-ordering inside one loop rather than a new critical
structure, and it is a further reason not to cost a wave by its
flip-flop count.

Between launch and capture the path holds **62 cells, 58 of them at
minimum drive, including 9 `sg13g2_buf_1` repair buffers** **[fact]**.
`docs/28` section 3.4's observation that this flow does not size cells
on the critical path is therefore **only partly closed**: the post-GRT
resizer sized 49 gates across 46 endpoints, but the path that ends up
worst afterwards is still a minimum-drive path. That is what a resizer
that has met its margin target looks like, and it is the honest reading
of the +0.519 ns plateau in section 5.2's table.

`docs/28` section 5.1's stage picture reproduces on this run, derated
**[fact, slow-corner setup at each stage]**:

| Point in the flow | Parasitics | Slow setup |
|---|---|---:|
| `12-openroad-staprepnr` | wireload estimate | -2.1839 |
| `31-openroad-stamidpnr` | post-global-placement | -10.7197 |
| `36-openroad-stamidpnr-1` | post-CTS estimate | **+2.2061** |
| `44-…-resizertimingpostgrt`, entering | post-GRT estimate | **-1.9730** |
| `44-…-resizertimingpostgrt`, leaving | post-GRT estimate | +0.5190 |
| `45-openroad-stamidpnr-3` | post-GRT estimate | +0.4067 |
| `57-openroad-stapostpnr` | **extracted (RCX)** | **+1.2262** |

Both of `docs/28` section 5.1's findings hold under the derate. The
post-CTS estimate is **4.18 ns optimistic** against the post-GRT one,
which is why the post-CTS resizer still reports
**`RSZ-0098 No setup violations found`** even now **[fact,
`37-openroad-resizertimingpostcts`]** — it is asked at the one point
where the design looks clear. And the post-GRT estimate is again
**pessimistic against extraction, by 0.82 ns**, the safe direction.

## 6. Tile budget

Twelve tiles at the 6x2 shape, `DIE_AREA 0 0 1289.28 313.74`
**[fact, `resolved.json`]**:

| | `tr-margin` (`docs/28`) | **`signoff-6x2`** | Move |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Die area, um2 | 404,499 | **404,499** | — |
| Core area, um2 | 392,988 | **392,988** | — |
| Placed cell area excl. fill, um2 | 185,785 | **191,588** | +5,803, +3.12 % |
| **Utilization** | 47.2751 % | **48.7516 %** | +1.48 pts |
| Cells excl. fill | 12,246 | **12,546** | +300 |
| Sequential cells | 1,277 | **1,296** | **+19** |
| Timing-repair buffers | 2,386 | 2,532 | +146 |
| of which setup buffers | 7 | **20** | +13 |
| Routed wirelength, um | 466,001 | **472,381** | +6,380, +1.37 % |
| Synthesis cells | 9,686 | **9,834** | +148 |
| Synthesis cell area, um2 | 152,099.79 | **155,462.93** | +3,363.14, +2.21 % |

**[fact]**.

**Against the 70 % planning criterion `docs/15`, `docs/22` and `docs/23`
use: 48.75 % used, 21.25 points spare.** In absolute terms
**201,400 um2 of the 392,988 um2 core is unoccupied**, and 83,504 um2 of
it is still below the criterion. The +19 flip-flops are exactly the two
RTL waves: 8 for the queue entry parity (`docs/29`), 2 for the
dispatcher check field and 9 for the `CNT_EVQ_PAR` counter and its edge
register (`docs/30`).

**Timing is still the binding budget, and it is one block's.** The
per-cone decomposition of `docs/28` section 3.1, re-run on this run's
1,664 sign-off paths **[fact,
`57-openroad-stapostpnr/nom_slow_1p08V_125C/max.rpt`]**:

The eight worst startpoint cones, by best slack of any path launching
from each:

| Rank | Startpoint | Worst slack, derated |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | `u_pilot.u_lif._5474_` | **+1.2262** |
| 2 | `u_pilot.u_lif._5478_` | +1.7509 |
| 3 | `u_pilot.u_lif._5475_` | +7.0837 |
| 4 | `u_pilot.u_lif._5460_` | +7.8998 |
| 5 | `u_pilot._5248_` | **+8.8980** |
| 6 | `u_pilot._5352_` | +9.2848 |
| 7 | `u_pilot._5367_` | +10.6283 |
| 8 | `u_pilot.u_evq_in.u_rptr_c._15_` | +10.8586 |

**The four tightest cones are all inside `u_pilot.u_lif`, and the first
cone outside it has +8.8980 ns — 44.5 % of the cycle — of slack.**
`docs/28` section 8.1's conclusion is unchanged by two RTL waves and by
the derate: only `lif_core` is tight. Neither the queue parity of
`docs/29` nor the dispatcher check field of `docs/30` appears in this
list; the first queue structure to appear is a pointer TMR replica at
rank 8, with **9.6 ns more slack than the critical path**.

**The tile budget is not the constraint and has not been close to it
since the move to 6x2.** `docs/28` section 5.3's rule still stands and
is the reason none of that spare area was spent: measured there, buying
timing by growing the netlist loses 4.36 ns, because this design is
wire-dominated. The +5,803 um2 here is the cost of RTL that had to
exist, plus 0.2 % of targeted resizing, not an attempt to trade area
for delay.

---

## 7. The census guards

Section 4.3 counts the netlist by hand. `sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py`
counts it automatically, and its five shipped-netlist guards are
provenance-gated: they **skip** unless a run on disk was *built from*
RTL declaring the module, because a netlist-shaped skip condition would
skip on exactly the symptom they exist to catch.

**Before this run, two of them skipped [fact]:**

```
$ .venv/bin/pytest sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py -q -rs
33 passed, 2 skipped
SKIPPED [1] ...:1313: no LibreLane run on disk was built from RTL declaring
            aer_par_bank, where the entry-parity check field lives
SKIPPED [1] ...:1363: no LibreLane run on disk was built from RTL declaring
            pilot_chk_bank, where the dispatcher check field lives
```

Those are exactly the two structures `docs/29` and `docs/30` added. The
runs that witnessed them were placed outside the repository and are
gone, so the guards had no witness on disk.

**After this run, all five pass by name [fact]:**

```
$ .venv/bin/pytest sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py -v -k real_hardening
test_config_tmr_survives_the_real_hardening_flow            PASSED
test_pointer_tmr_survives_the_real_hardening_flow           PASSED
test_entry_parity_survives_the_real_hardening_flow          PASSED
test_dispatcher_check_field_survives_the_real_hardening_flow PASSED
test_valid_flag_rails_survive_the_real_hardening_flow       PASSED
5 passed, 30 deselected

$ .venv/bin/pytest sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py -q -rs
35 passed in 110.79s
```

**35 passed, 0 skipped.** The five guards assert, by name and against
this run's shipped netlist:

| Guard | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `test_config_tmr_survives_the_real_hardening_flow` | **three configuration banks at 55** |
| `test_pointer_tmr_survives_the_real_hardening_flow` | **twelve pointer banks at 3** |
| `test_valid_flag_rails_survive_the_real_hardening_flow` | **eight valid-flag rails at 1** (six names, two of which appear once per queue instance) |
| `test_entry_parity_survives_the_real_hardening_flow` | **two parity banks at 4** |
| `test_dispatcher_check_field_survives_the_real_hardening_flow` | **the dispatcher check bank at 2** |

The run un-skips them because its yosys JSON header names
`aer_par_bank`, `aer_ptr_bank`, `pilot_chk_bank`, `aer_flag_rail`,
`lif_flag_rail` and `pilot_flag_rail` among the elaborated modules
**[fact, `05-yosys-jsonheader/*.h.json`]** — the provenance rule
`docs/30` section 7.3 settled on, which is about what the run was handed
and not about what came out.

**This closes a durability problem, not only a check.** `docs/28`
section 10 item 10 and `docs/30` section 7.3 both record the guards
skipping for want of a witness. `hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/` is in
`RUN_TREES`, so `signoff-6x2` is a witness that stays put, and the two
newest structures are now guarded on every test run rather than on
whoever last hardened outside the tree.

---

## 8. Is this submittable as it stands?

**No — and what is missing is a configuration change and one re-harden,
not a measurement.**

### 8.1 What is established

The design, at 6x2, on the RTL at `bc91c71`, hardened with the adopted
timing configuration, **passes every sign-off deck this repository can
run**: Magic DRC 0, KLayout DRC 0, KLayout XOR 0, Netgen LVS 0 on all
four counters, route DRC 0, antenna 0, power grid 0, disconnected pins
passed, illegal overlap passed, and setup and hold at 0 violations on
all three corners **with a real 5 % OCV derate applied by the flow and
the setup checker pointed at every corner**. `flow__errors__count` is 0.
Slow-corner margin **+1.2262 ns, 6.13 % of the cycle, 53.27 MHz**.
Utilization 48.75 % against a 70 % criterion. The redundancy census is
intact and all five shipped-netlist guards pass by name.

**That is a submittable design.** It is not yet a submittable
submission.

### 8.2 What is missing, exactly

**1. The blocking item: the six keys are not in `tt/src/`.** Section 2.
The shuttle builds from `tt/src/config.json`, which carries none of
them, and `subpath-6x2` measures what that produces on this same RTL:
**-0.7696 ns and 18 violating endpoints at the slow corner, -1.8321 ns
derated** — reported by the flow as clean, because the setup checker
would be looking at the typical corner. **If the submission is made
today, this is what is fabricated.**

The fix is one entry in `CONFIG_OVERRIDES` in
`scripts/gen_tt_submission.py` followed by
`python3 scripts/gen_tt_submission.py`:

```python
CONFIG_OVERRIDES: "dict[str, object]" = {
    "SYNTH_HIERARCHY_MODE": "deferred_flatten",
    "TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT": 5.0,
    "SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS": ["*"],
    "PNR_CORNERS": ["nom_typ_1p20V_25C", "nom_slow_1p08V_125C"],
    "RUN_POST_GRT_DESIGN_REPAIR": 1,
    "RUN_POST_GRT_RESIZER_TIMING": 1,
    "GRT_RESIZER_SETUP_SLACK_MARGIN": 0.5,
}
```

`scripts/` is outside this document's ownership, and section 2.4
measures why editing `tt/src/config.json` directly is not a substitute:
the generator reverts it and `sw/tests/test_tt_submission.py` fails on
it. **After that change the submission must be re-hardened**, because
no run in this repository will have been built from the file the
shuttle reads. `signoff-6x2` is the prediction of what that run gives,
not the run itself, and the two configurations differ only in path
resolution — an `[estimate]` that a re-harden turns into a `[fact]` in
about 50 minutes.

**2. `mkconfig.py` will silently revert the two flow-defect fixes.**
Section 2.3. `config.json` carries `TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT` and
`SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS` as hand edits to a generated file, and
`mkconfig.py --check` already reports it as drifted. Once item 1 puts
the keys in `tt/src/config_merged.json`, re-running `mkconfig.py`
regenerates `config.json` correctly and the drift closes by itself; until
then, anyone who runs it removes both fixes. `mktiming.py` now refuses
to generate `config.signoff-6x2.json` if either key is missing from its
base, which contains the blast radius but does not remove the trap.

**3. Max fanout is not gated.** Section 4.2. 84 violations at the slow
corner, stable across every run, and no `Checker.MaxFanout` exists in
this flow. Not a regression and not a blocker, but it is an ungated
number in a sign-off set and this document will not report it as though
a checker looked at it.

**4. Not re-verified against this netlist:** gate-level simulation and
gate-level fault injection. `docs/27` section 9 lists what a new netlist
requires, and this is a new netlist. A concurrent workstream is running
that campaign against this run directory as this is written; its results
are not this document's to report.

**5. `docs/00-index.md` does not name this document**, so
`test_doc_links.py` fails. Section 9.4 has the line to add.

### 8.3 The one-line answer

**The design closes. The submission does not carry what makes it
close.** Nothing in section 4 needs re-measuring; item 1 of section 8.2
needs doing, and then one re-harden to turn the estimate into a fact.
There are three weeks to the 2026-09-21 shuttle close, and the change is
seven lines.

---

## 9. Corrections for the integrator

**No document other than this one is edited.**

### 9.1 `docs/28-timing-recovery.md`

| Location | Current | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| §6.3, "Magic DRC, KLayout DRC and Netgen LVS were still executing … this configuration must not be submitted until they are read" | as written | **read.** `tr-margin`'s own run directory has since completed: Magic DRC 0, KLayout DRC 0, Netgen LVS 0 with all four unmatched counters 0 **[fact, `final/metrics.json`]**. But `tr-margin` is a run of RTL that has moved twice since, so section 4 of this document supersedes it rather than confirming it. |
| §10 item 7 | open | **closed** by section 4 here, on current RTL |
| §10 item 2, "`SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS` is set in this workstream's configs only" | as written | **true of all six keys, not one** (§2.1 here), and still open |
| §6.2, "carried in `hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/config.tr-margin.json`" | as written | that file does **not** carry `TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT`, so a run from it as committed is un-derated (§2.2 here). `config.signoff-6x2.json` is the first file carrying all six keys |
| §5.3 / `mktiming.py`'s `tr-best` note, "composing a lever worth -4.36 ns with one worth +0.85 ns has a predictable answer" | as written | **not established.** `docs/29` and `docs/30` both hardened `config.tr-best.json` — `DELAY 0` composed with the post-GRT repair — and report +0.4306 and +1.0423 ns derated, not the large negative the composition argument predicts. The composition was never measured by `docs/28` and the two documents that did measure it did not note the contradiction. Section 9.3 |

### 9.2 `docs/21-pilot-datasheet.md`

§7.1's worst slow-corner setup slack and Fmax should quote this
document's run: **+1.2262 ns and 53.27 MHz at `nom_slow_1p08V_125C`,
derated**, on `signoff-6x2`. `docs/28` §9.1's derate caveat no longer
applies to this run: the derate is applied by the flow, and section 3.2
is the evidence.

### 9.3 `docs/29` and `docs/30`

Both describe `config.tr-best.json` as "the recovered configuration".
It is not the configuration `docs/28` section 6.2 adopted —
`config.tr-margin.json` is — and the two differ in two keys:
`tr-best` sets `SYNTH_STRATEGY: DELAY 0` and omits
`GRT_RESIZER_SETUP_SLACK_MARGIN`. **So no run before this one had ever
hardened the adopted configuration on the RTL those two waves
produced**, which is the gap this document closes. Their timing
conclusions are not disturbed by that — both waves close on either
configuration — but the label should be corrected, and `docs/28`
section 5.3's prediction about `DELAY 0` in composition is
contradicted by their own measurements (section 9.1).

### 9.4 `docs/00-index.md`

`docs/31` is not named there, and
`sw/tests/test_doc_links.py::test_every_document_is_reachable_from_the_index`
fails for that reason **[fact, measured; it also names `docs/32`, which
a concurrent workstream added]**. `docs/00-index.md` is outside this
document's ownership. The entry to add, in the format of the rows

## 10. 2026-08-31 — the re-harden from the regenerated submission configuration

Status of this section: **section 8.2 item 1 is closed.** The six keys
are in `scripts/gen_tt_submission.py`'s `CONFIG_OVERRIDES` as of commit
`0c22de4`, `tt/src/config.json` has been regenerated to carry them, and
the configuration the shuttle would actually build has now been
hardened end to end rather than predicted. The prediction was right: the
run reproduces `signoff-6x2` on **194 of the 196 sign-off metrics
`final/metrics.json` records, to the last digit**, and the two that
differ are the two decks the submission configuration deliberately does
not run — both measured separately here, both zero. Section 10.9 is the
verdict.

Run tag **`submission-6x2`**, at
`hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/submission-6x2`, pinned to `0c22de4`.

### 10.1 Which configuration was hardened, and why it is the right one

**`tt/src/config_merged.json`, regenerated by the Tiny Tapeout tooling
from `tt/src/config.json` — not `tt/src/config.json` itself.** That
distinction is the whole point of this run, because the defect section 2
reports is exactly that the file being measured was not the file that
builds.

The chain, read out of the tooling rather than assumed **[fact,
`tt/tt/project.py`]**:

- `tt_tool.py --harden` calls `Project.harden()` (line 516).
- `harden()` calls `create_merged_config()` (line 522) **before** it
  invokes LibreLane, and that function reads `src/config.json`, applies
  `src/user_config.json` over it with `dict.update`, and writes
  `src/config_merged.json` (lines 481-484).
- The LibreLane command line it then runs names **`src/config_merged.json`**
  and nothing else (line 535).

So `config.json` is an input to the file that builds, and
`config_merged.json` is the file that builds. It is also **gitignored**
(`tt/.gitignore` line 9), together with `user_config.json` — they are
derived artifacts regenerated on every harden, which is why the stale
copies on disk before this run carried none of the six keys and why that
was not itself a defect.

`tt_tool.py --ihp --create-user-config` was run to regenerate both, and
the merge was then audited **[fact]**:

- `user_config.json` came back **byte-identical** to the copy on disk.
- `config_merged.json` gained exactly the six keys and nothing else:

```
$ diff config_merged.before.json tt/src/config_merged.json
25a26,36
>   "TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT": 5.0,
>   "SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS": ["*"],
>   "PNR_CORNERS": ["nom_typ_1p20V_25C", "nom_slow_1p08V_125C"],
>   "RUN_POST_GRT_RESIZER_TIMING": 1,
>   "RUN_POST_GRT_DESIGN_REPAIR": 1,
>   "GRT_RESIZER_SETUP_SLACK_MARGIN": 0.5,
```

- **`TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT` survives the merge as the Python float
  `5.0`, not as the integer `5`** **[fact, `type()` on the parsed
  value]**. Section 3.2's defect is a Tcl integer-division defect, so
  the type surviving `json.load` / `dict.update` / `json.dump` is the
  property that had to be checked, and it does. None of the seven keys
  `create_user_config` writes collides with any of the six, so the
  `update` cannot shadow them.

**How the run was pinned.** `hw/openlane/pin_rtl.py` was pointed at
`tt/src/config_merged.json` as its base, against `HEAD` = `0c22de4`.
The resulting config is that file with `VERILOG_FILES` and
`FP_DEF_TEMPLATE` absolutised into a disposable snapshot and nothing
else changed — verified key by key: **the key sets are equal and the
only two values that differ are those two paths** **[fact]**. The
snapshot is legitimate because `tt/src/*.v` and `HEAD:hw/rtl/*.v` are
the same blobs for all eight sources (section 10.2), so pinning buys the
immutability `pin_rtl.py` exists for without changing what is
synthesized.

**How `submission-6x2` differs from `signoff-6x2`.** Compared key by
key, the two configurations differ in exactly three places **[fact]**:

| Key | `signoff-6x2` | `submission-6x2` |
|---|---|---|
| `RUN_KLAYOUT_DRC` | 1 | **0** |
| `RUN_KLAYOUT_XOR` | 1 | **0** |
| `VERILOG_INCLUDE_DIRS` | set | **absent** |

Every other key, including all six recovery keys, `CLOCK_PERIOD`,
`DIE_AREA`, `PL_TARGET_DENSITY_PCT` and `SYNTH_HIERARCHY_MODE`, is
identical. The two KLayout keys are the upstream template's "Save some
time" defaults; the Tiny Tapeout precheck job runs those decks
separately, so they are **not** raised here — raising them would make
this run something other than the submission path, which is the mistake
this document exists to correct. Both decks were run afterwards over the
same GDS instead (section 10.4). `VERILOG_INCLUDE_DIRS` is absent
because in `tt/src/` the sources and `npu_regs.vh` are co-located, and
the snapshot preserves that co-location.

### 10.2 Provenance

`make -f tools.mk toolcheck`: `yosys version = 0.67+146 (pinned
0.67+146)`, no mismatch warning **[fact]**. LibreLane 3.0.5,
ihp-sg13g2 pinned at `c4b8b4e5e7a05f375cca3815d51b3a37721fbf5c`,
`sg13g2_stdcell`, `FP_DEF_TEMPLATE` the 6x2 pin frame **[fact,
`resolved.json`]**. One addition to the toolchain table in section 1.1:
the Tiny Tapeout precheck deck of section 10.7 needs **KLayout 0.30.9**
(`~/.local/opt/llbin/klayout`); the system KLayout 0.28.16 aborts
partway through the PDK's `ihp-sg13g2.drc` and reports a failure that is
a tool-version artifact rather than a geometry finding **[fact,
measured both ways]**.

**The blob list.** `pin_rtl.py` materialised `0c22de4:hw/rtl`; the seven
files in `VERILOG_FILES` plus the include are the ones the run
synthesized **[fact]**:

```
$ python3 hw/openlane/pin_rtl.py HEAD tt/src/config_merged.json <scratch>/pin-submission-6x2
pinned to HEAD (0c22de4d8a2a)
  ba4e5b0d2e0c934a7ebcd575866fb0eb73d722e4  hw/rtl/aer_fifo.v
  72f4f0af662b7bb07fdf43bf244e622d03db5e0d  hw/rtl/lif_core.v
  e6c1e646643840e2a553924b56dfab64022e5c39  hw/rtl/npu_regbank.v
  9aaaa394e7a6ef855f5584fb85d53e688ac3e0b5  hw/rtl/npu_regs.vh
  873b57d3572bf821bf71ea30dd6e18a16b30a0da  hw/rtl/pilot_top.v
  89e62789ad016c7cb51ad69247f6066335074f8c  hw/rtl/scrub.v
  f7c7ec187a0df4eb09a8405dcda285de0fc2e44e  hw/rtl/secded_dec.v
  b5710b8a679c3e378e74953b621b99f0d8dc3014  hw/rtl/secded_enc.v
  62b5f4d2a1eae095d9d4a8634ede55237e2c924d  hw/rtl/tmr_voter.v
  e294afcf03e1947906086beeba2fd0c40b29441d  hw/rtl/tt_um_melihakbulut_nssoc.v
```

`npu_regbank.v` and `scrub.v` are materialised but not in the file list
and are not synthesized, as in section 1.2. **These are the same ten
blobs `signoff-6x2` was pinned to at `bc91c71`** — `0c22de4` changed
`scripts/`, `tt/`, `docs/` and `hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/`, and no file
under `hw/rtl/`. So the RTL is held fixed across the comparison of
section 10.5 and any difference in the result would be attributable to
configuration alone.

The eight sources the submission tree ships were checked against those
blobs directly, because the shuttle reads `tt/src/*.v` and not
`hw/rtl/*.v`: **`git hash-object tt/src/<f>` equals
`git rev-parse 0c22de4:hw/rtl/<f>` equals `git hash-object hw/rtl/<f>`
for all eight** **[fact]**. `tt/` is clean at `HEAD`.

**The run was a single uninterrupted pass**: 74 step directories, no
duplicate step name, `error.log` empty **[fact]**. Section 4.2's note
about `signoff-6x2`'s resumed passes and its orphaned duplicate
`62-magic-writelef` does not apply here, which removes the one caveat a
reproducer of that run had to carry. Summed step runtime **43.1 min**
over 74 steps, of which Magic DRC is 27 min 24 s and detailed routing
10 min 15 s **[fact, `runtime.txt`]**.

### 10.3 The derate, audited where it is decidable

Section 3.2 established that `resolved.json` is lossy for this key and
must not be used to audit it. It reproduces here: **`resolved.json`
records the integer `5`** in this run too **[fact]**, exactly as it does
in `tr-margin`, which did not derate at all. The audit was therefore
done on what Tcl actually reads and on what the sign-off STA actually
consumed **[fact]**:

| Evidence | `submission-6x2` |
|---|---|
| `resolved.json` | `"TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT": 5` — **lossy, proves nothing** |
| Step `_env.tcl` | `set ::env(TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT) 5.0` |
| Flow log line | `Setting timing derate to: 5.0%` |
| **Flow-written SDC** | **`set_timing_derate -early 0.9500` / `-late 1.0500`** |

The written SDC is the artifact that decides, and the specific file was
identified rather than assumed: `57-openroad-stapostpnr/state_in.json`
names its `sdc` input as
`54-openroad-fillinsertion/tt_um_melihakbulut_nssoc.sdc`, and **that
file carries the two `set_timing_derate` lines at lines 100-101**
**[fact]**. `nom_slow_1p08V_125C/sta.log` line 15 of the sign-off step
logs `Setting timing derate to: 5.0%`. So the +1.2262 ns below is a
derated number, established from the constraint file the analysis read
and not from a configuration key.

That SDC is also **byte-identical to `signoff-6x2`'s**
(`md5 3eecfd957669331f2626c0ed8aa7dc0f`) **[fact]**.

### 10.4 The complete sign-off set

`python3 hw/openlane/signoff_report.py hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/submission-6x2`,
off `final/metrics.json` **[fact]**. Step numbers are this run's; they
match `signoff-6x2`'s through `61-klayout-render` and then run three
lower, because this run has no XOR pair and no orphaned duplicate
`magic-writelef`.

| Deck / checker | Step | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Magic DRC** | `64-magic-drc`, `65-checker-magicdrc` | **0 — passed** |
| **KLayout DRC** (PDK deck) | not a flow step here | **0 — see below** |
| **KLayout XOR** | not a flow step here | **0 — see below** |
| **Netgen LVS** | `68-netgen-lvs`, `69-checker-lvs` | **0 — passed** |
| LVS unmatched nets | | **0** |
| LVS unmatched devices | | **0** |
| LVS unmatched pins | | **0** |
| LVS property fails | | **0** |
| LVS net / device differences | | **0 / 0** |
| Illegal overlap | `67-checker-illegaloverlap` | **passed** |
| Route DRC | `49-checker-trdrc` | **0 — passed** |
| **Antenna**, final | `48-openroad-checkantennas-1` | **0 nets, 0 pins** |
| Antenna diodes inserted | | **1** |
| Power-grid violations | `30-checker-powergridviolations` | **0 — passed**, 0 on VPWR and 0 on VGND |
| Disconnected pins | `51-checker-disconnectedpins` | **6, 0 critical — passed** |
| Wirelength checker | `53-checker-wirelength` | **passed** |
| **Setup violations, all corners** | `70-checker-setupviolations` | **0 — passed** |
| **Hold violations, all corners** | `71-checker-holdviolations` | **0 — passed** |
| Max slew / max cap, all corners | `72`, `73` | **0 / 0 — passed** |
| Lint / synth checks / unmapped cells / netlist assigns | `02`-`04`, `07`-`09` | **all passed** |
| `design__violations` | | **0** |
| **`flow__errors__count`** | | **0** |

**Timing, all three corners, derated**, `57-openroad-stapostpnr` on
extracted parasitics, ns **[fact]**:

| Corner | Setup ws | Setup vio | Setup TNS | Hold ws | Hold vio | Hold TNS |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **`nom_slow_1p08V_125C`** | **+1.2262** | **0** | **0.0000** | **+0.6041** | **0** | **0.0000** |
| `nom_typ_1p20V_25C` | +8.1033 | 0 | 0.0000 | +0.2829 | 0 | 0.0000 |
| `nom_fast_1p32V_m40C` | +12.1374 | 0 | 0.0000 | +0.1029 | 0 | 0.0000 |

`Checker.SetupViolations` is pointed at `["*"]` in this run's
`resolved.json`, against the PDK's `TIMING_VIOLATION_CORNERS: ["*typ*"]`
**[fact]**, so the zero in the setup row is a zero across three corners
and not across one. That is the property section 2.2 measured the
submission path as lacking, and it is now a property of the submission
path.

**The two decks the submission configuration does not run.** With
`RUN_KLAYOUT_DRC` and `RUN_KLAYOUT_XOR` at 0 the flow skips them and
says so — `Misc.ReportManufacturability` logs
`klayout__drc_error__count not reported. KLayout.DRC may have been
skipped.` **[fact]** — so `final/metrics.json` has no entry for either.
Both were then run over **this run's own streamed GDS**, with the
commands `signoff-6x2` used verbatim, read out of that run's `COMMANDS`
files **[fact]**, and written to
`hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/submission-6x2-geomdecks/`:

- **KLayout XOR**, LibreLane's `scripts/klayout/xor.drc` between
  `59-magic-streamout/*.magic.gds` and
  `60-klayout-streamout/*.klayout.gds`:
  `Total XOR differences: 0`, `%OL_METRIC_I design__xor_difference__count 0`.
  One reproducer note: `--ignore` takes a value, and the flow passes it
  the **empty string**, which the `COMMANDS` file renders as a run of
  spaces. Re-typing the command without `--ignore ""` makes
  `OptionParser` swallow the first GDS path as the option's value and
  the script then fails with `Read error on file: (errno=21)`, which
  reads like a corrupt layout and is not one **[fact, hit and
  diagnosed]**.
- **KLayout DRC**, the PDK's own
  `ihp-sg13g2.drc` in `run_mode=deep` with `no_recommended=True` over
  `59-magic-streamout/*.gds`:
  `%OL_METRIC_I klayout__drc_error__count 0`.

Neither key moves a layout bit, so running them afterwards reads the
same geometry the flow streamed. **[fact for both numbers; that running
them inside the flow would give the same two zeros is an `[estimate]`,
though `signoff-6x2` did run them inside the flow on a GDS whose only
difference from this one is its embedded timestamps — section 10.5.]**

**Max fanout is still 84 and still gated by nothing** — 84 at each of
the three corners, the same figure section 4.2 records for
`signoff-6x2`, `tr-margin` and `subpath-6x2` **[fact]**. Section 8.2
item 3 is unchanged by this run.

**The 6 disconnected pins are the same six deliberate ones**,
`design__critical_disconnected_pin__count` is 0 and the checker passed
**[fact]**.

**The redundancy census on the shipped netlist**, counted by hand on
`54-openroad-fillinsertion/tt_um_melihakbulut_nssoc.nl.v` as in
section 4.3 **[fact]**:

| Structure | Expected | Found |
|---|---|---|
| Total mapped flip-flops | 1,296 | **1,296** |
| Configuration TMR `u_cfg_a/b/c` | 55 each | **55 / 55 / 55** |
| AER pointer TMR, twelve banks | 3 each | **3 in all twelve** (36 across the two queues) |
| Queue entry parity `u_evq_*.u_par` | 4 each, 2 banks | **4 / 4** |
| Dispatcher check field `u_disp_chk` | 2 | **2** |
| Valid-flag rails `u_ohv_a/b`, `u_rdv_a/b`, `u_op_a/b` | 1 / 2 / 1 | **1 / 1 / 2 / 2 / 1 / 1** |

### 10.5 Against `signoff-6x2`

They do not merely agree closely. **They agree exactly.**

`final/metrics.json` holds 196 keys across the two runs. **194 are
equal; the 2 that differ are `klayout__drc_error__count` and
`design__xor_difference__count`, absent in `submission-6x2` because the
submission configuration does not run those steps** **[fact, key-by-key
diff]**. Both were measured separately at 0 (section 10.4), which is
what `signoff-6x2` records for them.

That equality is not a coincidence of rounding. The two runs are
identical at the artifact level **[fact, `md5sum`]**:

| Artifact | `signoff-6x2` vs `submission-6x2` |
|---|---|
| `06-yosys-synthesis/*.nl.v` | **identical** (`db840015f28b…`) |
| `54-openroad-fillinsertion/*.def` (routed DEF) | **identical** (`b1d218065b2f…`) |
| `54-openroad-fillinsertion/*.sdc` | **identical** (`3eecfd957669…`) |
| `final/nl/*.nl.v` | **identical** (`d83db86fc257…`) |
| `final/pnl/*.pnl.v` | **identical** (`ebe9ac589a21…`) |
| `final/lef/*.lef` | **identical** (`c38639dd3382…`) |
| `final/spef/nom/*.spef` | identical **apart from its `*DATE` header line** |
| `59-magic-streamout/*.gds` | same length; **184 differing bytes** of 20,760,838 |
| `60-klayout-streamout/*.klayout.gds` | same length; **456 differing bytes** of 11,141,388 |

The two GDS pairs are the only artifacts that are not bit-identical or
identical-but-for-a-dated-header. The differing bytes sit in short runs
at regular offsets beginning at byte 15 and 27 of the stream, which is
where GDS puts the `BGNLIB` and `BGNSTR` modification and access
timestamps; **that the differences are timestamps and nothing else is an
`[estimate]`**. What carries the weight instead is a `[fact]`: the
routed DEF the two streamers were handed is **bit-identical**, and this
run's own magic-versus-klayout XOR over its own two streams is **0**.

The intermediate stages match too: post-GRT resizer **46 endpoints, 20
buffers inserted, 49 instances resized** on both, and slow-corner setup
at `31-openroad-stamidpnr` (-10.7197), `36-openroad-stamidpnr-1`
(+2.20612) and `45-openroad-stamidpnr-3` (+0.406695) agrees to every
digit reported **[fact]**.

Runtime is the one honest difference: **43.1 min against 45.9 min**,
machine contention, not the design.

**So the fix is equivalent in the strongest available sense: the
submission path now produces the same GDS, the same netlist and the same
timing as the configuration section 4 signed off.** Section 8.2 item 1
called `signoff-6x2` "the prediction of what that run gives, not the run
itself, and the two configurations differ only in path resolution — an
`[estimate]` that a re-harden turns into a `[fact]`". It is a `[fact]`
now, and the estimate was correct.

One consequence worth stating for the concurrent gate-level workstream:
`docs/32` re-ran both gate-level suites against `signoff-6x2`, and
`submission-6x2/final/nl/*.nl.v` is **the same file, bit for bit**. Its
results therefore describe this netlist without re-running anything
**[fact for the identity; that the suites would reproduce is an
`[estimate]` only in the trivial sense that they were not literally
re-invoked]**.

### 10.6 The census guards

Run against this run on disk **[fact]**:

```
$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py -q -rs
35 passed in 95.19s

$ .venv/bin/python -m pytest sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py -v -k real_hardening

test_valid_flag_rails_survive_the_real_hardening_flow        PASSED
5 passed, 30 deselected
```

**35 passed, 0 skipped**, and the five shipped-netlist guards pass **by
name**, not by the run list happening to contain an older witness.
`submission-6x2` satisfies the provenance rule of section 7 on its own:
its `resolved.json` says `SYNTH_HIERARCHY_MODE: deferred_flatten`, it
has a `final/nl`, so `_hardening_netlists()` accepts it **[fact,
the collector re-run standalone lists it]**; and `_run_declares()`
applied to its `05-yosys-jsonheader/*.h.json` returns **True for
`aer_par_bank`, `aer_ptr_bank`, `pilot_chk_bank`, `aer_flag_rail`,
`lif_flag_rail`, `pilot_flag_rail` and `pilot_cfg_bank`** **[fact]** —
the modules appear as yosys `$paramod` specialisations, which the
guard's substring rule matches. So this run is a witness in its own
right and would un-skip all five even if `signoff-6x2` were removed.

`hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/submission-6x2-geomdecks/` has neither a
`resolved.json` nor a `final/nl`, so the collector skips it and it
cannot be mistaken for a run.

### 10.7 The Tiny Tapeout tooling, on the submission as a package

**[fact for every row]**

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `tt_tool.py --ihp --check-docs` | **`Documentation check passed successfully.`**, exit 0 |
| `tt_tool.py --ihp --create-user-config` | exit 0; port check clean, `DIE_AREA` resolved to `0 0 1289.28 313.74`, `user_config.json` unchanged, `config_merged.json` regenerated with the six keys (section 10.1) |
| `tt_tool.py --ihp --print-top-module` | `tt_um_melihakbulut_nssoc` |
| `scripts/gen_tt_submission.py --check` | **`tt/ matches the generator (30 files)`**, exit 0 |
| `sw/tests/test_tt_submission.py` | **16 passed** — the `tt/MANIFEST.sha256` and generator-drift gates |
| `hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/mktiming.py --check` | **`all 8 variants match`**, exit 0 |
| GDS to OAS conversion, the one design-data transformation `create_tt_submission()` performs | **886,297-byte OAS, round-trips with top cell `tt_um_melihakbulut_nssoc`, `TT_PDK = ihp-sg13g2`, 25 layers, 45 cells** |

**The Tiny Tapeout precheck, run in full on this run's GDS.** This is
the deck the shuttle's `precheck` job runs and the one whose failure
costs a resubmission round. `tt/tt/precheck/precheck.py --tech
ihp-sg13g2`, `PDK_ROOT=~/.ciel`, KLayout 0.30.9, against
`59-magic-streamout/tt_um_melihakbulut_nssoc.gds` with the run's LEF and
netlist beside it **[fact]**:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| KLayout pin label overlapping drawing | **pass** |
| KLayout SG13G2 DRC | **pass** |
| KLayout zero area | **pass** |
| KLayout Checks (top macro name, forbidden layers, prBoundary) | **pass** |
| Pin check | **pass** |
| Boundary check | **pass** |
| Layer check | **pass** |
| Cell name check | **pass** |
| Analog pin check | **pass** |
| Verilog syntax check | **pass** |

`INFO: Precheck passed`. Ten of ten; the other six checks in
`precheck.py` are `sky130A`- or `gf180mcuD`-only and do not apply. The
same deck was run on `signoff-6x2`'s GDS first, as a control on the
invocation, and also passed. Reports are kept at
`hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/submission-6x2-geomdecks/tt-precheck/`.

**Two `tt_tool.py` subcommands do not apply locally and were not
forced.** `--print-stats` and `--print-warnings` both read
`tt/runs/wokwi/`, the run directory `Project.harden()` creates, and this
repository hardens under `hw/openlane/` instead; they fail on the
missing path rather than on anything about the design **[fact,
`IndexError` out of `project.py:732`]**. `--create-tt-submission`
additionally needs `runs/wokwi/pdk.json` and
`runs/wokwi/final/commit_id.json`, which `harden()` writes and which no
run here has. Fabricating those to make the subcommand run would have
tested the fabrication; the one part of it that transforms design data,
the OAS conversion, was exercised directly instead and is the row above.

### 10.8 Section 8.2, item by item

| Item | State after this run |
|---|---|
| **1. The six keys are not in `tt/src/`** | **Closed.** They are, they survive the merge as the right types, and the configuration that carries them has been hardened to the end of the flow with the result of section 10.4. |
| **2. `mkconfig.py` will silently revert the two flow-defect fixes** | **The trap is gone; the drift is not, and it changed shape.** See below. |
| **3. Max fanout is not gated** | **Unchanged.** 84 at all three corners, no `Checker.MaxFanout` in the flow. |
| **4. Not re-verified against this netlist: gate level** | **Closed by `docs/32`**, whose netlist is bit-identical to this one (section 10.5). |
| **5. `docs/00-index.md` does not name this document** | **Closed for `docs/31`**, which `0c22de4` added. `test_doc_links.py` still fails, now naming **`docs/32-gate-level-refresh.md`** alone **[fact, 1 failed, 43 passed]**. That entry belongs to the concurrent workstream and `docs/00-index.md` is outside this document's ownership. |

**Item 2 in detail, because the prediction was wrong.** Section 8.2 said
that once the keys reached `tt/src/config_merged.json`, "re-running
`mkconfig.py` regenerates `config.json` correctly and the drift closes
by itself". It does not. `mkconfig.py --check` now reports **six**
drifted files rather than one **[fact, exit 1]**:

```
DRIFT: hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/config.json
DRIFT: hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/config.pnrcorners.json
DRIFT: hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/config.flatten.json
DRIFT: hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/config.klayoutdrc.json
DRIFT: hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/config.3x4.json
DRIFT: hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/config.6x2.json
```

The **direction has reversed**, which is the part that matters.
Re-deriving in memory and diffing against disk **[fact]**:

- For `config.json`, the derivation is now a **superset** of what is on
  disk: it would *add* `PNR_CORNERS`, `RUN_POST_GRT_DESIGN_REPAIR`,
  `RUN_POST_GRT_RESIZER_TIMING` and `GRT_RESIZER_SETUP_SLACK_MARGIN`,
  and it no longer *removes* `TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT` or
  `SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS`. **The specific defect section 2.3 named —
  a tool that quietly reverts a correct setting — is gone.**
- For **`config.6x2.json`, the derivation would add all six keys.** That
  file is the one `subpath-6x2` was hardened from, the control that
  measures what the broken submission path produces. Anyone who runs
  `mkconfig.py` and then re-runs `subpath-6x2` gets the adopted
  configuration and reproduces section 4, not section 2.2. **Section
  2.2's -0.7696 ns is no longer reproducible from the file named there,
  and a reproducer needs `config.6x2.json` as committed at `bc91c71`.**
  That is a provenance note, not a defect, and it is recorded here
  rather than left to be discovered.

`mkconfig.py` was deliberately **not** re-run: `hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/`
is this workstream's, but regenerating those six files would destroy the
control this document's own section 2.2 rests on, and the drift is now
benign.

### 10.9 Is it submittable?

**Yes, on the evidence this repository can produce.**

The design, at 6x2, on the RTL at `0c22de4`, **hardened from the file
the Tiny Tapeout tooling itself derives and hands to LibreLane**, passes
every sign-off deck: Magic DRC 0, KLayout DRC 0, KLayout XOR 0, Netgen
LVS 0 on all four unmatched counters and both difference counters,
route DRC 0, antenna 0 nets and 0 pins, power grid 0 on both rails,
disconnected pins 6 with 0 critical and the checker passed, illegal
overlap passed, and setup and hold at 0 violations on all three corners
with a real 5 % OCV derate proven applied in the flow-written
constraint file and the setup checker pointed at every corner.
`flow__errors__count` 0. Slow-corner margin **+1.2262 ns, 6.13 % of the
cycle**, 48.75 % utilization against a 70 % criterion, the redundancy
census intact at 1,296 flip-flops, all thirty-five guards passing by
name, and the Tiny Tapeout precheck passing ten checks of ten on the
GDS this run streamed.

Section 8.3 said "the design closes; the submission does not carry what
makes it close." **The submission carries it now, and the carrying was
measured rather than argued.**

**What remains, and none of it blocks a submission:**

1. **Max fanout is reported by no checker.** 84 violations at every
   corner, stable across every run and every configuration in this
   repository. Not a regression; recorded because a sign-off set should
   not present an ungated number as though a checker looked at it.
2. **`docs/00-index.md` does not name `docs/32`**, so
   `test_doc_links.py` fails. One line, owned by the concurrent
   gate-level workstream.
3. **`mkconfig.py --check` reports six drifted files.** Benign in the
   direction it now drifts (section 10.8), but it makes `subpath-6x2`
   non-reproducible from the file section 2.2 names unless that file is
   taken from `bc91c71`.
4. **`RUN_KLAYOUT_DRC` and `RUN_KLAYOUT_XOR` stay 0 in the submission
   configuration**, deliberately, matching upstream. Both decks were run
   here and are 0, and the shuttle's own precheck job runs the KLayout
   DRC deck regardless. Putting them back inside the flow would cost
   about **2 min 5 s** — `signoff-6x2` spent 12.7 s on the XOR step and
   1 min 52.8 s on the KLayout DRC step **[fact, `runtime.txt`]** — but
   it would be a departure from the upstream template, which is why it
   was not made here.
5. **The submission has not been pushed to a repository where the
   `gds` action would run it.** Everything above is the same flow, the
   same LibreLane, the same PDK hash and the same configuration file
   that action would use, but the action itself has not executed. That
   is the last unmeasured step and it is not one this repository can
   take.
