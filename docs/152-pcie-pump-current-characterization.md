## Measured result — 7 October 2026

The exact thirteen-device pump/filter slice from the connected 570-instance study now completes all **twelve nominal 34 ns simulations**: idle, source, sink and both commands at clamped control voltages of 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 V. Each capture contains 108,811 samples and 28 columns. All thirteen device screens and the prescribed command/supply/clamp checks pass in each case. These are finite model screens, not device qualification or closed-loop operation.

The [inventory](../hw/soc/pcie-evidence/20261007-pump13-points/inventory.json) binds sources, controls, all native results and the complete public capsule. The [205-member capsule](https://github.com/Melihakbulut221/nssoc/releases/download/evidence-20261006-pcie-closure/pcie-pump13-twelve-points-20261007.tar.gz) contains the raw gzip waveforms and retained failures. Its 164,566,312 bytes have SHA256 `3c5e7689b8f87856f7a6fb51db0169252315b82fec680575552a312c21dc2767`; complete local member readback and a full anonymous download match. External simulator/model dependencies are hash-pinned, not bundled in this capsule.

## Currents and limits

Two independent ideal-current-source operating points establish the simulator clamp-current sign. Positive current into the clamp means net current delivered to the control node. Four deliberate sign/observation mutations are rejected, giving six sign controls.

The following means use the complete fixed 4–34 ns measurement window. Commands are ideal 0/2.5 V levels; AVDD is 2.3 V and DVDD is 2.5 V in this experiment.

| Clamp voltage | Idle current (µA) | Source command (µA) | Sink command (µA) | Both commands (µA) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0.5 V | +46.088506 | +82.085090 | +5.706672 | +41.719351 |
| 0.6 V | +33.017214 | +69.013235 | −9.713786 | +26.299899 |
| 0.7 V | +19.945937 | +55.941259 | −24.095419 | +11.918648 |

The slice provides opposite net-current directions at 0.6 and 0.7 V under these ideal commands. At 0.5 V the sink command still leaves positive net current, so this point does not demonstrate bidirectional control. Passing electrical screens alone would not detect that functional limitation.

These slice currents must not be substituted directly for the loaded PLL current. The actual 570-instance command and boundary waveforms must first match the subtraction baseline, or a separately measured correction must establish the difference. The earlier 0.7 V loaded experiment also retains its divide-by-four failure. No tuning interval, feedback polarity, loaded reachability or PLL lock is accepted here.

## Execution and saved-data validation

The former 45 MiB per-file native limit could overflow the 64 MiB case budget before a failed raw tail was saved. The only executable-driver change reduces that native limit to 8 MiB. The graph, twelve stimuli, step size of 0.3125 ps, 34 ns duration, sample limits and physical checks are unchanged. Two native files plus the conservative gzip, receipt, source and failed-tail allowances total 53,104,010 bytes, leaving 14,004,854 bytes inside the case budget. An actual owned child hits the 8 MiB limit and is reaped; the test does not merely inspect a configured constant.

There are **72 passing source/storage/startup/resource controls**, including that real child, followed by the six actual sign controls. A single controller ran all twelve cases sequentially on CPU 10 with a 2 GiB address-space limit and no healthy-run elapsed timeout. Closed waveforms are synchronized on SSD; this is not a resumable solver checkpoint or live power-loss-tail guarantee.

A separate saved-data reader checks every result input/output hash, all raw bytes, all sample-count trailers and all thirteen device-screen records. Across **1,305,732 samples**, it independently sums **672 current integrals** using scalar trapezoids and `math.fsum`; the maximum mean-current arithmetic difference is 2.710505431213761e−20 A. This is a separate computation by the same root reviewer, not an external review. The initial reader failed to normalize internal-device current names; that attempt remains in the capsule, and the corrected reader changes only the name mapping and integral census.

Next work is exact loaded-boundary replay, diagnosis of the retained divide-by-four failure, and then source-bound closed-loop acquisition and convergence checks. Full CDR/PHY operation, physical integration, final chip timing and manufacturing acceptance remain open.
