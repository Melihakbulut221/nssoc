# Market positioning and competitive landscape

Research-phase report. This document places the project against the GR801
reference product and the wider space edge-AI silicon market, then states
the positioning rules that bind all external communication about this SoC.

Throughout the document, statements are labelled as **[fact]** (traceable to
a cited public source) or **[estimate]** (inference, industry heuristic, or
project judgment). Where a price or date is an estimate, no cited source
claims it.

## 1. The reference product: GR801 market position

### 1.1 What GR801 is and who it is for

GR801 is the first device of Frontgrade Gaisler's GRAIN (Gaisler Research
Artificial Intelligence NOEL-V) product line: a radiation-hardened SoC
combining a fault-tolerant NOEL-V RV64GC RISC-V management processor with a
licensed BrainChip Akida 1.0 neuromorphic accelerator on STMicroelectronics
28 nm FDSOI. The public product brief was released April 2026 with status
"under development" (https://www.gaisler.com/products/gr801). **[fact]**

Commercialization is backed by a Swedish National Space Agency (SNSA)
contract to bring the first neuromorphic SoC for space applications to
market
(https://www.frontgrade.com/news/frontgrade-gaisler-launches-new-grain-line-and-wins-snsa-contract-commercialize-first-energy,
https://riscv.org/blog/frontgrade-gaisler-to-commercialise-neuromorphic-ai-for-space/).
**[fact]** The Akida IP license for space deployment was announced by both
companies
(https://www.gaisler.com/news-events/frontgrade-gaisler-licenses-brainchips-akida-ip-to-deploy-ai-chips-into-space).
**[fact]** Advertised applications include lightning detection, cloud-cover
detection, change monitoring, collision avoidance, and rover traversability
mapping (https://www.eenewseurope.com/en/frontgrade-gaisler-to-commercialise-neuromorphic-ai-for-space/).
**[fact]**

Target customer profile: institutional space programs (ESA, national
agencies, primes) that already fly Gaisler LEON/NOEL silicon and buy
ESCC-qualified parts with full radiation lot data. Gaisler's flight
heritage (GR712RC, GR740 as the ESA Next Generation Microprocessor,
http://microelectronics.esa.int/gr740/index.html) makes GR801 the default
choice for missions that must show qualification paperwork to an agency
customer. **[estimate**, but strongly supported by Gaisler's ESA-anchored
product history**]**

### 1.2 Price class

No public list price exists for GR801, GR740, or GR716 flight parts;
Gaisler quotes on request (https://www.gaisler.com/products/gr740,
https://www.gaisler.com/products/gr716a). **[fact]**

Public reference points for the price class:

- Industry surveys place fully qualified space-grade processors at
  USD 10k-200k+ per unit, with rad-hard devices commonly "tens of
  thousands of dollars"
  (https://hubble.com/community/comparisons/why-radiation-hardening-matters-for-satellite-processors-and-what-it-costs/,
  https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2024/ca175595_radiation-semiconductors/di-tmtp23-radiation-semiconductors.pdf).
  **[fact** that these sources state these ranges**]**
- The cost drivers are structural: multi-year qualification campaigns
  amortized over unit volumes in the dozens-to-hundreds
  (https://hubble.com/community/comparisons/why-radiation-hardening-matters-for-satellite-processors-and-what-it-costs/).
  **[fact]**

Working assumption for this project: GR801 flight parts (GR801-AS, ESCC9030
screened) will land in the EUR 20k-100k class per unit, consistent with
GR740/GR712RC-class flight silicon; engineering models cheaper but still
thousands of EUR. **[estimate]** This is the number that matters for the
positioning argument in Section 3: a 6U CubeSat with a total payload budget
under EUR 500k cannot spend a large fraction of it on one component.

### 1.3 Qualification timeline

The brief specifies the GR801-AS flight model with ESCC9030 screening, TID
50 krad(Si) guaranteed by platform, 100 krad(Si) testing planned, SEL TBC
(https://www.gaisler.com/products/gr801). **[fact]** The device is "under
development" as of the April 2026 brief. **[fact]**

Typical Gaisler cadence from product brief to qualified flight parts has
been multi-year (GR740: ESA NGMP development through the 2010s, flight
parts shipping from late 2021, https://www.gaisler.com/products/gr740).
**[fact]** Expect GR801 engineering silicon first, with ESCC-qualified
flight models roughly 2-4 years after the brief, i.e. 2028-2030.
**[estimate]** This window matters: the qualified-neuromorphic-SoC market
is not served today, and low-cost alternatives that fly earlier can build
heritage before GR801 flight models are broadly available.

All rows **[fact]** as to product existence and stated specs; price-class
columns where implied are **[estimate]**.

### 2.2 Structure of the market

Three tiers are visible:

1. **Qualified rad-hard silicon** (GR801, PIC64-HPSC, Versal XQR,
   QLS1046-Space): institutional missions, long qualification cycles,
   tens-of-thousands-and-up unit prices. **[estimate** on prices, per
   Section 1.2 sources**]**
2. **Radiation-characterized COTS systems** (SpaceCloud iX10, S-A1760
   Venus, Series-300-style screening): LEO and short missions, board-level
   products built on commercial GPU/CPU silicon, thousands-to-tens-of-
   thousands per board. **[estimate]**
3. **Flight experiments with commercial neuromorphic parts** (Loihi on
   TechEdSat-13, AKD1000 on Optimus-1): demonstrations, not products.
   **[fact]**

### 2.3 The open/low-cost gap

Observations that define the gap this project targets:

- **No open-architecture device exists in any tier.** Every product above
  is proprietary silicon or a proprietary board. No vendor publishes RTL,
  verification suites, or fault-injection data. A mission integrator
  cannot independently audit the fault-tolerance claims of any of them.
  **[fact** by absence; no counterexample found in the survey**]**
- **No chip-level neuromorphic product exists below the rad-hard tier.**
  Between "USD 20k+ qualified SoC" (GR801, when released) and "unrated
  commercial AKD1000 on a custom board" there is nothing: no
  fault-tolerant-by-architecture, low-cost, chip-level event-driven
  inference device for CubeSat-class missions. **[fact** by absence in
  this survey; kept under review**]**
- **The COTS-systems tier proves LEO demand at low radiation ratings.**
  Aitech explicitly sells the S-A1760 at >1.5 krad TID for LEO/short
  missions (https://aitechsystems.com/product/s-a1760-space-gpgpu/);
  Unibap sells SpaceCloud into CubeSat/microsat programs
  (https://unibap.com/news/order-for-spacecloud-ix10-from-hawaii-space-flight-laboratory/).
  Missions accept modest ratings when the price and power fit. **[fact]**
- **Neuromorphic-in-space is validated but unserved at low cost.** NASA
  flew Loihi on a 3U CubeSat precisely because event-driven processors
  suit nano-satellite power budgets
  (https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210026935); BrainChip is building
  space heritage for Akida (https://brainchip.com/akida-in-space/). The
  demand signal exists; the affordable, fault-tolerant supply does not.
  **[fact** for the flights, **estimate** for the demand inference**]**

## 3. Positioning of this project

**Section held back.** This section carried product-line positioning, price bands and customer profiles and is not published,
for the reason `LICENSES.md` section 2.1 gives: it is commercial
material rather than a research result. The heading is kept so that the
document's own section numbering, and every cross-reference to a later
section of this file, still resolve.

Section 4 below — the binding positioning-language rules — **is**
published, and is the section the rest of the corpus actually cites.

---

## 4. Positioning language rules (binding)

These rules were established in a prior export review for the developer's
existing product line and are restated here as binding policy for this SoC.
All public text — README, datasheets, pitch material, shuttle submissions,
conference abstracts — must comply.

1. **Radiation class: LEO / 10-30 krad(Si) class.** State the design
   target as LEO-class total dose in the 10-30 krad(Si) range, pending
   test data. Never state or imply a rating that has not been measured on
   silicon.
2. **"Fault-tolerant", never "rad-hard".** The chip is fault-tolerant by
   architecture (TMR, ECC, scrubbing, monitors) on a commercial bulk
   130 nm process. "Radiation-hardened" implies process-level and
   qualification claims this project does not make. This is also the
   honest engineering description: bulk CMOS has no intrinsic SEL
   immunity (see docs/00-reference-brief.md, observation 5).
3. **Export-control red lines.** Never claim, target, or advertise TID
   ratings at or above 100 krad(Si), and never use marketing language that
   maps the device onto space-qualified rad-hard categories in
   EAR 9A515 / dual-use 3A001-class threshold territory. Public
   positioning stays strictly below those thresholds; no SEL/SEE
   guarantee language beyond what measured data supports. When in doubt,
   the lower claim wins.
4. **Multi-market framing.** Public positioning is "fault-tolerant edge
   inference for harsh environments" — small-satellite LEO payloads as
   the lead market, with industrial/high-reliability terrestrial uses
   (radiation environments in medical/energy, safety-critical monitoring)
   named alongside. The device is not marketed as a military or
   strategic-space component.
5. **Fact/estimate discipline in public claims.** Any figure published
   externally (power, TID, SEU rates, fault coverage) must be traceable to
   measurement or clearly labelled as a design target, mirroring the
   fact/estimate separation used in these research documents.

Rule 1-3 rationale: the GR801 brief itself illustrates the other side of
the line — 50 krad platform-guaranteed with 100 krad testing planned under
ESCC9030 (https://www.gaisler.com/products/gr801) is precisely the claim
territory this project must stay out of, in wording as well as in fact.

---

## 5. Summary

- GR801 will own the institutional, ESCC-qualified neuromorphic-SoC
  segment at a tens-of-thousands-EUR price class **[estimate]**, with
  flight models plausibly 2028-2030 **[estimate]**.
- The competitive field (PIC64-HPSC, Versal XQR, QLS1046-Space, SpaceCloud,
  Aitech) leaves an empty cell: chip-level, fault-tolerant, event-driven
  inference at CubeSat prices with an open architecture. **[fact by
  absence in this survey]**
- This project fills that cell as a low-cost fault-tolerant neuromorphic
  SoC and credibility vehicle, deliberately not competing with GR801, and
  deliberately differentiated from GOLDFINCH-1 (peripheral frame-based
  accelerator vs. standalone event-driven SoC).
- All public language follows the binding rules of Section 4:
  fault-tolerant, LEO/10-30 krad class, below export-control claim
  thresholds, multi-market framing.
