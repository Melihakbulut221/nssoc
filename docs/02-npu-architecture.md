# Event-driven inference engine: architecture options and recommendation

Scope: this report surveys open-source and published event-driven SNN
accelerator designs, extracts what is publicly known about the Akida 1.0
architecture referenced by the GR801 brief, and proposes candidate
architectures for the clean-room event-driven fabric of this project on a
130 nm open-PDK flow. It ends with a recommendation, fallback conditions,
and open questions.

Conventions:

- **Fact** — taken from a cited public source or from this project's own
  verified prior work.
- **Estimate** — derived here (scaling arithmetic, area/FF budgets,
  workload fit). All tables of budgets in section 4 are estimates unless a
  cell cites a source.

Constraint carried over from `00-reference-brief.md`: the fault-injection
observability flow used in prior projects is Verilog-based; VHDL cores
break it. Every candidate below is required to be synthesizable Verilog
(Verilog-2005 subset acceptable to Icarus Verilog and Verilator).

## 1. Survey of existing designs

### 1.1 Akida 1.0 — the reference IP (proprietary, not reusable)

Facts from public sources:

- GR801 integrates Akida 1.0 as "eight neural processing nodes connected
  in a mesh network," each node containing "four convolutional or fully
  connected engines," with hardware support for 1/2/4-bit hybrid quantized
  weights, multi-pass processing for large networks, and 3.2 MB of RAM
  private to the Akida unit
  (https://www.gaisler.com/products/gr801, summarized in
  `docs/00-reference-brief.md`).
- The commercial AKD1000 chip is described as 80 NPUs organized in nodes
  of four, mesh-networked, with event-based processing that only computes
  on non-zero activations and direct node-to-node communication without
  CPU involvement
  (https://brainchip.com/technology/,
  https://www.embedded.com/brainchips-akida-npu-redefining-ai-processing-with-event-based-architecture/).
- AKD1000 carries 8 MB of SRAM for weights/activations; weights and
  activations of 1/2/4 bits (8-bit added in Akida 2.0); input encoded with
  pixel-to-event conversion and rank-order coding rather than classical
  LIF dynamics; on-chip continual learning restricted to a final
  fully-connected layer with binary weights; reported power in the tens of
  milliwatts (~30 mW figure reported)
  (https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/akida-brainchip/).
- Akida 1.0 layer support is restricted: only certain layer sequences are
  legal (e.g., Conv2D cannot feed Dense without Flatten), so the software
  stack (MetaTF) compiles a constrained network family, not arbitrary
  graphs (same source).
- Frontgrade Gaisler licensed Akida IP in December 2024 for space SoCs
  (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241215304799/en/Frontgrade-Gaisler-Licenses-BrainChips-Akida-IP-to-Deploy-AI-Chips-into-Space);
  AKD1000 silicon has flown in LEO inside the ANT61 "Brain" computer on
  Optimus-1
  (https://www.hackster.io/news/brainchip-s-neuromorphic-akida-goes-orbital-as-optimus-1-takes-the-ant61-brain-computer-into-space-920ed9ba76cb).

Estimate (cross-check worth recording): AKD1000 has 8 MB across 80 NPUs,
i.e. ~100 KB per NPU; the GR801 configuration has 3.2 MB across 8 nodes x
4 engines = 32 engines, again ~100 KB per engine. The "engine plus ~100 KB
local SRAM" granularity is therefore a consistent, public-figure-derived
design point for an Akida-class node, and a useful sanity anchor when
sizing a clean-room node.

Reported workload result: a spiking DS-CNN on Akida reaches 91.73% on a
Google Speech Commands keyword-spotting task
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00957).

### 1.2 Open-source SNN cores (RTL available)

**ODIN** (UCLouvain, C. Frenkel). Single 256-neuron, 64k-synapse crossbar
neurosynaptic core, time-multiplexed; SDSP online learning in the
synapses; neurons configurable as LIF or 20-behavior Izhikevich. Silicon:
28 nm FDSOI, 0.086 mm² core, 12.7 pJ/SOP. Source is plain Verilog
(`neuron_core.v`, `synaptic_core.v`, `scheduler.v`, AER output, SPI
config), Solderpad v2.0 license, with documentation
(https://github.com/ChFrenkel/ODIN, https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07858).
Facts. Key structural point: synapse weights live in a 64k x 4-bit SRAM
and neuron state in a small SRAM, with one physical update pipeline
time-multiplexed over all neurons — the architecture is
"SRAM plus a small datapath," not a physical crossbar.

**tinyODIN** (same author lineage; UCLouvain/UZH/KU Leuven/TU Delft
copyright). ODIN stripped of online learning and Izhikevich support: 256
twelve-bit LIF neurons, 64k 4-bit synapses in a crossbar-addressed SRAM,
AER out, SPI config. Verilog RTL plus SystemVerilog testbench, Solderpad
v2.1 (https://github.com/ChFrenkel/tinyODIN). Fact. This is the closest
existing open design to what this project needs for a first-pass engine:
inference-only, low-bit weights, event-driven, small, and in Verilog.

**ReckOn** (UCLouvain). Spiking recurrent neural network processor with
on-chip learning (modified e-prop) over second-long timescales; 28 nm
FDSOI, 0.45 mm² core, 5.3 pJ/SOP at 0.5 V; Verilog RTL with SV testbench,
Solderpad v2.1 (https://github.com/ChFrenkel/ReckOn). Fact. Relevant
because temporal workloads (keyword spotting, telemetry time series) map
naturally to recurrent spiking topologies; the cost is a more complex
state and training story.

**SNE** (ETH Zurich, PULP platform). "Sparse Neural Engine": a digital
energy-proportional accelerator for sparse event-based convolutions,
4-bit quantized eCNN, ~4.5 TOP/s/W reported, integrated in the Kraken
RISC-V SoC; RTL open at https://github.com/pulp-platform/sne
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10687). Fact. Relevant as the only open RTL
reference for *event-based convolution* (the Akida differentiator vs
plain fully-connected SNN cores). Caveat: PULP-style SystemVerilog with
Bender dependency management — usable with Verilator, likely painful with
Icarus; treat as an architectural reference, not a drop-in.

**RANC** (University of Arizona). Open ecosystem (C++ simulation + FPGA
emulation) behaviorally compatible with IBM TrueNorth's
core/crossbar/router architecture; scales to 259k neurons in emulation
(https://github.com/UA-RCL/RANC, https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00624). Fact.
Useful as a mesh-of-cores architectural reference and as an independent
software simulator concept, though its RTL targets FPGA emulation rather
than ASIC hardening.

### 1.3 Large research architectures (lessons, not candidates)

- **Loihi** (Intel): 128 cores, up to 1024 digital spiking neurons per
  core, 33 MB SRAM, 14 nm, 60 mm²
  (https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/loihi-intel/).
  Lesson: even at 14 nm, neuromorphic scale is SRAM-dominated; the
  per-core structure is again "neuron/synapse SRAM + shared update
  logic + NoC."
- **TrueNorth** (IBM): cores time-multiplex one physical circuit over 256
  neurons — confirmation that time-multiplexing is the standard digital
  pattern (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.03690).
- **SpiNNaker / SpiNNaker2** (Manchester/Dresden): neurons in software on
  many small ARM cores (SpiNNaker2: 152 Cortex-M4F)
  (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.03690). Lesson: a software-neuron approach
  buys flexibility but pays in power and determinism; for this project it
  would also move all "SNN correctness" into firmware, which weakens the
  silicon-level differentiation and the fault-injection story. Not
  pursued.

### 1.4 Published SNN silicon at older / open nodes

- 180 nm mixed-signal SNN chip: 3.6 mm² core, 94.66% MNIST, ~1.06 mW
  average (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8272117/). Fact, but
  mixed-signal — not reproducible in a standard-cell open flow; cited only
  to bound what the node can do.
- 130 nm SNN character-recognition ASIC: ~1 mm x 1 mm, 16.7 mW
  (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271425442_Spiking_neural_network_based_ASIC_for_character_recognition).
  Fact (older, thin publication) — order-of-magnitude anchor for digital
  SNN at exactly this node class.
- SKY130A open-PDK SNN accelerator (OpenLane flow): 3.7 uJ/inference at
  89 MHz (https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3960/short6.pdf). Fact — direct evidence
  that a digital SNN inference engine closes timing and produces usable
  energy numbers in a 130 nm open PDK with the same tool family this
  project uses.
- Tiny Tapeout scale: a programmable recurrent SNN
  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01419) and a stochastic LIF neuron
  (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2606.23532) have been taped out on SkyWater
  130 nm via open flows. Facts.
- In-house: **tt-um-lif-crossbar**, this developer's Tiny Tapeout chip —
  an 8x8 LIF-neuron crossbar on a 2x2 tile, taken through the open flow
  to a shipped submission. This is the direct ancestor of Candidate A and
  the source of the verified Verilog LIF neuron and crossbar update
  logic. **No accuracy figure is claimed for it here.**

  **CORRECTED 2026-09-09.** This bullet said "~70.7% classification
  accuracy verified pre-tapeout" and tagged it *Fact (project's own
  verified result)*. It was neither verified nor, on the evidence, an
  accuracy. `docs/13` section 10.6 item 6 had already found that the
  number collides with itself — `docs/15` and `docs/17` both use
  **70.66 %** for the *placement utilisation* of the same chip — and
  removed it there pending [D-7]. **The removal did not reach this
  document, and this is the document that travels**: the public mirror
  publishes `docs/02` and holds `docs/13` back as commercial material, so
  the claim would have shipped and its withdrawal would not.

  Re-checked at source 2026-09-09, which `docs/13` could not do: **the
  string `70.66` does not occur anywhere in the `tt-um-lif-crossbar`
  repository** — not in a document, not in a run tree, not in a metrics
  file. Its recorded placement utilisations are 82.33 %, 81.3 % and
  74.6 %. So **both readings are unsupported**, not just the accuracy
  one, and the two documents that use it as a utilisation reference point
  are using a number with no artefact behind it either.

  What is left standing, because it is true and checkable: this project
  has **no application-accuracy result for any design**, and never had
  one. The lesson is `docs/64`'s, arriving from a new direction — a
  correction filed in one document does not correct the corpus, and the
  document a correction fails to reach may be the one a reader sees.
- Context: the developer's GOLDFINCH-1 accelerator project formally
  evaluated and rejected an SNN engine *for that product* because its
  small-MLP workloads favored a weight-stationary INT8 systolic array.
  That decision does not transfer here: the GR801 reference product is
  neuromorphic by definition, the workloads include temporal/event data,
  and event-driven sparsity is the power story. The two projects are
  deliberately different bets.

### 1.5 What CubeSat payloads actually need

- **Telemetry anomaly detection** is the most defensible on-board AI
  workload for small satellites: ESA's OPS-SAT CubeSat produced a public
  anomaly-detection benchmark (OPSSAT-AD) with 30 baseline ML methods,
  and the community now treats the older NASA SMAP/MSL sets as flawed
  (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05035-3,
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04730). Input dimensionality is small (tens
  of channels), models are small, and latency requirements are mild —
  this fits a fully-connected/recurrent SNN engine with kilobyte-class
  weights. Fact (benchmark), estimate (fit).
- **Event-based vision in space** is real but early: Falcon Neuro flew two
  DAVIS240C event sensors on the ISS for lightning/sprite detection
  (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/remote-sensing/articles/10.3389/frsen.2024.1436898/full),
  event-sensor LEO lifetime has been studied
  (https://doi.org/10.3390/s25216599), and a 2026 survey maps the
  application space (star tracking, debris, Earth observation)
  (https://arxiv.org/html/2606.01280). Facts. An event camera front-end is
  the workload that genuinely requires event-based *convolution* and mesh
  scale; without it, a fully-connected engine covers the mission set.
- **Keyword spotting** (Google Speech Commands class) is not itself a
  spacecraft workload, but it is the standard public benchmark for
  low-power temporal SNN inference (Akida's own demos use it, 91.73%
  cited above) and doubles as a proxy for 1-D RF/telemetry temporal
  classification. Keeping GSC-subset KWS as an acceptance benchmark makes
  results comparable with the literature. Estimate/judgment.

## 2. Design constraints for the 130 nm fabric

From `00-reference-brief.md` and the survey:

1. Total NPU memory must land in the ~100–300 KB range (the SoC-level
   budget is "hundreds of kB" including CPU and buffers). Estimate.
2. All memories ECC-capable (SECDED) with scrubbing; control logic
   TMR-able; fault counters observable over the debug/management
   interface. Project requirement.
3. Verilog only, simulable in Icarus/Verilator, so that the established
   force/release fault-injection flow and its observability
   instrumentation work unchanged. Project requirement.
4. Weights 4-bit baseline (1/2-bit optional packing), matching both Akida
   1.0 practice and tinyODIN/SNE precedent. Fact (precedent), decision
   (baseline).
5. The RV32 management core handles configuration, weight loading, and
   multi-pass sequencing; the NPU must not require a host CPU in the
   spike-processing loop (Akida precedent: node-to-node communication is
   CPU-free). Decision.

Physical anchors used in the estimates below. Logic: a placed DFF plus
routing overhead ~30–60 um², so 10 kFF is on the order of 0.3–0.6 mm²
(estimate, open-PDK 130 nm class). SRAM: density is PDK-specific and the
project's own data spans a ~5x range, so no single "130 nm class" figure
is usable; the per-PDK bands below are this document's sizing basis,
sourced from `01-reference-decomposition.md` section 3.2 and
`04-technology-and-flow.md` section 3.1:

| SRAM path | Density | Area per Mbit |
|---|---|---|
| sky130 OpenRAM macros (open PDK) | ~57 kbit/mm² (17.4 um²/bit) | ~17.4 mm² |
| Commercial 130 nm SRAM compiler (NDA access, not assumed) | ~270–280 kbit/mm² (~3.6 um²/bit) | ~3.6 mm² |
| IHP SG13G2 foundry macros (`RM_IHPSG13_1P_*`) | ~25–40 KiB/mm² incl. periphery | ~3.2–5.1 mm² |

All three bands are estimates derived from published macro dimensions or
vendor-typical figures in the cited sections; the SG13G2 band is pending
measurement from the macro LEFs (`04-technology-and-flow.md` open
question 2), which becomes the authority once extracted. ECC overhead
(+22% bits for SECDED on 32-bit words) is carried inside the capacity
figures of the candidate tables below (e.g. "128 KB + SECDED ≈ 156 KB").

**NOTE ADDED 2026-09-09, and it governs every capacity and area figure
in section 3.** The codeword above is not the one that was built. **The
implemented weight memory is 64 data bits plus 8 check bits, 12.5 %
overhead, not 32 plus 7 at 21.875 %** — `10-npu-mvp-spec.md` section 5
fixes the physical word at "64 data bits = 16 weights, plus 8 SECDED
check bits (72-bit macro word, 12.5 percent overhead)" and derives
**128 KB data + 16 KB check = 144 KB**, and `hw/rtl/secded_enc.v` is a
(72,64) encoder whose elaboration guard refuses any other width, with
`hw/rtl/lif_core.v` line 244 spending one codeword on sixteen
consecutive weights. Fact, both files. The +22 % arithmetic is correct
for the 32-bit word it names — the minimal SECDED there is (39,32),
seven check bits, which is exactly what `43-core-hardening.md`
section 6.3 measured on the register file — but a 32-bit codeword is
not what a weight SRAM uses and never was here.

**What that costs the numbers below, and what it does not.** Every
figure derived from 156 KB is high by 156/144 = **8.33 % of the 144 KB
basis, which is 7.7 % of the number as quoted** (estimate, arithmetic).
Read across section 3: the Candidate B weight-SRAM row is 144 KB, its
SG13G2 band ~3.6–5.7 mm² rather than ~4–6.2, its sky130 OpenRAM figure
~20 mm² rather than ~22, the half-size fallback point 36 KB rather than
≈40 KB, and Candidate C's per-node "48 KB + ECC ≈ 58 KB" is ≈54 KB.
**The direction is conservative in every case — the memory and the die
area are overstated, not understated — and no decision in this document
turns over.** sky130 at OpenRAM density is still essentially the whole
die against the 25 mm² budget, so the 512-neuron working point is still
out of reach of it; SG13G2 is still inside the budget and still the
dominant NPU cost; F1 and the 256-neuron fallback are unchanged in
trigger and in purpose.

**Nothing below is renumbered or rewritten, by `64-document-reconciliation.md`
section 2's rule** — a superseded figure stays visible with a dated note
saying what replaced it, because silently editing "156" to "144" in five
places would leave `07-design-review.md` line 128 and
`10-npu-mvp-spec.md` line 15, both of which cite this document's 156 KB
row by name, pointing at a number that no longer exists. **Not fixed
here**: `10-npu-mvp-spec.md` calls its 144 KB "in line with the `docs/02`
estimate" and "consistent with the Candidate B budget", which is a claim
of agreement across the 8.33 % this note has just measured; that
sentence lives in a document this note does not own.
`64-document-reconciliation.md` reconciled seven numbers stated two ways
and did not reach this pair.

## 3. Candidate architectures

### Candidate A — scaled physical LIF crossbar ("more of the proven tile")

Direct scale-up of tt-um-lif-crossbar: a physically parallel N x N
crossbar (weights in flip-flops, one hardware neuron per column),
N = 32 as the working point, executed layer-by-layer under a small
sequencer, with weight reload between layers for multi-layer networks.

| Item | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Synapse storage | 32x32 x 4 b = 4 kb in FFs (~4.1 kFF) |
| Neuron state | 32 x 16 b = 512 FF |
| Control/sequencer/IO | ~2–4 kFF |
| Total FF | ~7–9 kFF (~0.3–0.5 mm² placed) |
| SRAM | None required (optional weight-overlay buffer 8–16 KB: ~0.2–0.6 mm² on SG13G2 macros, ~1.1–2.3 mm² at sky130 OpenRAM density) |
| Clock target | 25–50 MHz, easily met |

- Workloads: telemetry anomaly detection (small FC nets over tens of
  channels) — yes; KWS — marginal (needs external feature extraction and
  aggressive network shrinking; expect accuracy well below the 91.73%
  Akida reference); event-based vision — no.
- Verification burden: **low.** The neuron and crossbar are already
  verified silicon-bound RTL; new logic is the sequencer and reload path.
  Weeks, not months.
- Fault-tolerance observability: **best of the three.** Every synapse and
  membrane potential is a named FF — the existing force/release fault
  injector can target any bit directly, and TMR/partial-TMR can be applied
  selectively by instance. No SRAM macros to model or protect; the entire
  engine is scrub-free.
- Fundamental limit: FF-based weights do not scale. 64k synapses (the
  ODIN/tinyODIN working point) would need ~256 kb of FFs — roughly
  10–15 mm² by the DFF anchor above — which is not a serious option. Candidate
  A is capped at roughly 2–8 k synapses and is therefore a floor, not a
  destination.

### Candidate B — single time-multiplexed neuron core (ODIN/tinyODIN class)

One event-driven core: synaptic weights in SRAM (crossbar-addressed),
neuron state in a small SRAM or FF file, one physical LIF update pipeline
time-multiplexed across all neurons, AER event queues in and out, SPI/APB
configuration from the RV32 core. Inference-only (no SDSP), 4-bit weights
with 1/2-bit packing. Multi-pass execution: the RV32 core (or a small
DMA) reloads the weight SRAM between layers/passes, following the Akida
multi-pass concept.

Working point: 512 neurons, 256k synapses (512 x 512).

| Item | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Weight SRAM | 256k x 4 b = 128 KB + SECDED ≈ 156 KB |
| Neuron state | 512 x 24 b ≈ 1.5 KB (SRAM or ~12 kFF file) |
| Event queues/scheduler | 2–4 KB FIFO + ~3 kFF |
| Control datapath | ~5–8 kFF |
| Total | ~160 KB SRAM, ~10–20 kFF |
| Half-size fallback point | 256 neurons / 64k synapses → 32 KB + ECC ≈ 40 KB SRAM (tinyODIN-equivalent) |

- Workloads: telemetry anomaly detection — yes, comfortably; KWS — yes
  (256–512 neuron FC/recurrent SNNs on GSC subsets are the standard
  literature configuration; tinyODIN-class capacity); small event-based
  vision — partial (event histograms/downsampled frames into FC layers;
  no native convolution, so vision accuracy will trail an eCNN).
- Verification burden: **moderate.** The time-multiplexed pipeline,
  scheduler, and AER queues are the new risk; however tinyODIN provides a
  permissively licensed (Solderpad v2.1) Verilog reference implementation
  of exactly this microarchitecture, which can serve as an executable
  golden model even if the project RTL is written fresh. Note the
  clean-room obligation applies to *Akida*; Solderpad-licensed academic
  RTL may be studied and even reused with attribution — a policy decision
  is flagged in the open questions.
- Fault-tolerance observability: **good, with known work.** SRAM demands
  ECC + scrubbing and a fault-counter interface (already the project's
  standard pattern); the scheduler/controller FSMs are small enough for
  full TMR; membrane-potential upsets degrade gracefully (a corrupted
  potential decays or triggers one spurious spike) which is a genuinely
  favorable property of LIF dynamics worth demonstrating in the
  fault-injection campaign. Injection into SRAM contents is supported by
  the existing flow via behavioral memory models in Verilog.
- Physical (estimates from the section 2 per-PDK bands): ~156 KB SRAM is
  ~4–6.2 mm² plus logic on SG13G2 foundry macros — the dominant NPU cost,
  inside the 25 mm² SoC budget but materially tight — and ~4.6 mm² with
  commercial 130 nm compiler access. At sky130 OpenRAM density the same
  memory is ~22 mm², i.e. essentially the whole die: **the 512-neuron
  working point is out of reach of OpenRAM-density sky130** and exists
  only on the SG13G2 foundry SRAM macros (or commercial sky130 SRAM
  access). The 256-neuron half-size point (~40 KB: ~1.0–1.6 mm² on
  SG13G2, ~5.7 mm² at sky130 OpenRAM density) is the sky130-fallback
  configuration and exists precisely so the memory budget can be cut 4x
  without architectural change.

### Candidate C — small mesh of event-driven nodes (clean-room Akida-class)

2x2 mesh of nodes on an AER NoC; each node = one engine configurable as
fully-connected or event-based convolution (SNE demonstrates open-RTL
precedent for the conv mode), ~64 KB local weight/activation SRAM per
node (~100 KB Akida anchor, shrunk), shared multi-pass DMA from QSPI/main
SRAM, RV32 core orchestrating pass schedules.

| Item | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Per node: weight SRAM | 48 KB + ECC ≈ 58 KB |
| Per node: event/activation buffer | 8–16 KB |
| Per node: engine datapath + NoC port | ~10–15 kFF |
| Mesh total (4 nodes) | ~280–300 KB SRAM, ~50–70 kFF |
| NoC + DMA + config | ~10–15 kFF, 4–8 KB buffering |

- Workloads: all three — telemetry anomaly, KWS, and small event-based
  vision with native event convolution (e.g., 64x64 event-camera input,
  Falcon Neuro-class detection tasks). This is the only candidate that
  matches the GR801/Akida feature story rather than a subset of it.
- Verification burden: **high.** Four interacting engines, NoC
  arbitration, conv address generation, multi-pass DMA, and a compiler
  problem (mapping networks onto nodes) that does not exist for A or B.
  Realistically the largest single verification object in the whole SoC,
  larger than the RV32 subsystem.
- Fault-tolerance observability: workable but the hardest: distributed
  SRAM (4+ macro groups) means distributed scrubbers and per-node fault
  counters; NoC faults add a failure class (misrouted/dropped events)
  requiring new checkers (sequence counters, spike-count checksums per
  pass). All in Verilog by construction; SNE's SystemVerilog can inform
  the conv engine but should not be imported wholesale into the Icarus
  flow.
- Physical (estimates from the section 2 per-PDK bands): ~300 KB SRAM is
  ~7.5–12 mm² on SG13G2 foundry macros and ~43 mm² at sky130 OpenRAM
  density — at or beyond the whole-SoC memory budget from
  `00-reference-brief.md` even on the primary PDK, and larger than the
  entire die on open-PDK sky130. As a v1 target this over-reaches on
  every available memory path.

## 4. Recommendation

**Baseline: Candidate B**, architected from day one so that Candidate C
is its scale-out rather than a redesign:

1. Implement the single time-multiplexed core (512 neurons / 256k x 4-bit
   synapses, ECC SRAM, AER in/out, multi-pass reload) as the v1 engine.
   It covers the two workloads a CubeSat payload will actually be sold on
   (telemetry anomaly detection per OPSSAT-AD, KWS-class temporal
   classification), reuses the verified LIF neuron lineage from
   tt-um-lif-crossbar in the update pipeline, has an open Verilog
   reference microarchitecture (tinyODIN) to verify against, and fits the
   memory and observability budgets on the primary PDK (see the hard
   dependency below).
2. Freeze the AER event interface and the configuration map as if the
   core were one node of a mesh: node-addressed events, per-core fault
   counters, pass-schedule registers. Then Candidate C becomes
   "instantiate 2–4 cores plus a router and optionally swap one core's
   datapath for an event-conv engine" in a later phase, contingent on an
   event-camera payload actually being in the mission profile
   (see `05-market-positioning.md`).
3. Keep Candidate A alive as the **fallback**, not a parallel effort: the
   RTL substrate (LIF neuron, crossbar update) is shared.

**Hard dependency on the technology decision:** by the section 2 bands,
the v1 working point's ~156 KB weight memory is ~4–6.2 mm² on IHP SG13G2
foundry macros but ~22 mm² at sky130 OpenRAM density (estimates). The
512-neuron/256k-synapse configuration therefore requires the SG13G2
foundry SRAM macros or commercial sky130 SRAM access, and is out of
reach of OpenRAM-density sky130. The IHP-primary decision in
`04-technology-and-flow.md` is a hard dependency of this recommendation,
not an independent choice: losing it — or failing SRAM-macro integration
(trigger F1 below) — does not merely shrink Candidate B, it forces the
ladder down to the 256-neuron sky130 point or, if no SRAM macro
integrates at all, to Candidate A's latch/FF-based engine.

Fallback conditions (trigger → action):

- **F1.** SRAM macros on the chosen PDK fail characterization or flow
  integration (for the primary PDK this is the `RM_IHPSG13_1P_*`
  LVS/GDS-merge risk that `04-technology-and-flow.md` names as its own
  main fallback trigger), cannot support SECDED widths, or cannot be
  modeled in the Icarus fault-injection flow → the 512-neuron working
  point is gone (section 4 hard dependency). If an SRAM macro path still
  exists (sky130 OpenRAM), drop to Candidate B's 256-neuron/64k point
  (~40 KB ≈ ~5.7 mm² at OpenRAM density, estimate). If no SRAM macro can
  be integrated at all, the fallback is Candidate A with latch/FF-based
  weights (pure-FF 32x32 engine): a latch/DFF-array version of even the
  40 KB memory would be ~8–13 mm² at DFFRAM-class density
  (`04-technology-and-flow.md` section 3.1) and is not a viable middle
  step. The mission story narrows to telemetry anomaly detection only.
- **F2.** The time-multiplexed pipeline misses the verification gate
  (schedule) while the crossbar path is green → tape out Candidate A as
  the risk-reduction vehicle and carry B to the next shuttle.
- **F3.** KWS accuracy on the quantized 512-neuron network falls below a
  floor to be set in the benchmark definition (open question 8) →
  re-evaluate a ReckOn-style recurrent topology on the same engine before
  adding any hardware.
- **F4.** An event-camera payload is confirmed as a launch requirement →
  pull the Candidate C conv-engine study forward; do not retrofit
  convolution into the B datapath.

## 5. Open questions

1. **SRAM reality check (blocks sizing):** what macro sizes, port
   configurations, and ECC-friendly widths does the selected 130 nm open
   PDK actually provide, and at what mm²/Mb? (Status: answered at band
   level — section 2 now carries the per-PDK densities from
   `01-reference-decomposition.md` section 3.2 and
   `04-technology-and-flow.md` section 3.1. Outstanding: the
   LEF-measured density of the `RM_IHPSG13_1P_*` macros, tracked as
   docs/04 open question 2.)
2. **Reuse policy for Solderpad RTL:** does the project reuse
   tinyODIN/ODIN Verilog directly (legal under Solderpad v2.x with
   attribution), use it only as a golden reference model, or stay fully
   clean-room across the board for positioning reasons?
3. **Training/quantization toolchain:** Akida's MetaTF is proprietary;
   which open stack (e.g., snnTorch/Norse + QAT to 4/2/1-bit, or
   ANN-to-SNN conversion) produces deployable weights, and who owns the
   compiler from trained network to weight-SRAM image and pass schedule?
4. **Input encoding:** rate coding (as in the prior tile), rank-order
   coding (Akida's published choice), or direct event streams — and does
   one encoding serve both telemetry and audio front-ends, or does the
   engine need two input paths?
5. **Multi-pass ownership:** is layer/pass sequencing done by the RV32
   core (simple, slower, more observable) or a dedicated DMA/sequencer
   (faster, more RTL to verify), and what is the QSPI reload latency
   budget per pass?
6. **Neuron-state upset policy:** is graceful degradation of membrane
   potentials acceptable without protection (backed by a fault-injection
   measurement of accuracy-under-upset), or do mission requirements force
   parity/duplication on neuron state too?
7. **Mesh commitment point:** what concrete mission evidence (payload
   with an event camera, per `05-market-positioning.md`) would justify
   Candidate C's verification cost, and by which roadmap gate must that
   evidence exist?
8. **Benchmark definition:** fix the acceptance suite now — proposed:
   OPSSAT-AD subset (telemetry), GSC 10/12-class subset (KWS), and
   optionally N-MNIST or a Falcon Neuro-style event task (vision, only if
   C proceeds) — with accuracy floors and energy/inference targets per
   candidate.
9. **Clock and power targets:** the SKY130A precedent ran at 89 MHz and
   3.7 uJ/inference (https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3960/short6.pdf); what
   frequency and energy-per-inference targets should gate this design,
   given the spacecraft power budget assumed in
   `05-market-positioning.md`?
10. **External event interface:** should the AER input be exposed at the
    chip boundary (native event-sensor connectivity, Falcon Neuro-class
    payloads) in v1, or only internal with SPI/QSPI-fed events, deferring
    the pad and protocol cost?
