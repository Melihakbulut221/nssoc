# Toolchain resolution, shared by every makefile in this repository.
#
# Why this file exists. The formal gate used to resolve `sby` through a
# glob over several oss-cad-suite checkouts, taking whichever the
# wildcard listed first. On the development machine that silently
# selected a *different project's* toolchain, so a run of the 37-task
# formal gate was executed by tools nothing in this repository pinned.
# Three yosys builds were reachable at once: 0.67+146 in a Downloads
# checkout, 0.67+94 in a sibling project's tools directory, and a third
# in ~/.local/bin that a bare `yosys` resolves to. The results were not
# wrong, but they were not reproducible either, and a report that cannot
# name the tool that produced it is evidence of nothing.
#
# The rule here: one checkout, named explicitly, overridable, and
# verified. Set OSS_CAD_SUITE to point somewhere else; run
# `make -f tools.mk toolcheck` to see what would actually be used.

# The pinned checkout. Override on the command line or in the
# environment to use a different one:
#   make OSS_CAD_SUITE=$HOME/oss-cad-suite ...
OSS_CAD_SUITE ?= $(HOME)/Downloads/oss-cad-suite-linux-x64-20260804/oss-cad-suite

# The version this repository's recorded results were produced with.
# `toolcheck` compares against it and warns on a mismatch rather than
# failing, so a newer toolchain is usable but never silent.
