"""Break one module on purpose, so that the equivalence check can be
seen to fail.

    python3 formal/eqy/mutate.py voter out/mutant_tmr_voter.v
    python3 formal/eqy/mutate.py dec   out/mutant_secded_dec.v

A checker that has never returned red is not a checker. These two
mutations are the negative controls of `formal/eqy/Makefile`, and the
Makefile treats a control that PASSES as an error.

Both are chosen to be invisible to every other instrument in the
repository. The voter mutation drops one term of the majority function:
the module still has the same ports, the same zero flip-flops, and the
same cell count after mapping, so a flip-flop census cannot see it --
which is the whole reason `tmr_voter` is the first module checked here.
The decoder mutation flips one bit of one parity row: the codec still
encodes and decodes, still corrects most single-bit errors, and still
passes a smoke test; what it loses is the property `formal/secded.sby`
proves.

Each mutation asserts that it changed something. A mutation that does
not apply is a control that reports success while testing nothing,
which is the failure this file exists to prevent.
