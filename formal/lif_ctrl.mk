# Formal targets for the lif_core control path: command arbitration, the
# input and output handshakes, scan integrity and the spec section 11.4
# SAFE state.
#
# Standalone:      make -C formal -f lif_ctrl.mk lif_all
# As a fragment:   include lif_ctrl.mk   (from formal/Makefile), then add
#                  lif_all to the `everything` goal and lif_clean to
#                  `clean-all`. Every target name here is prefixed and
#                  phony, so the fragment cannot collide with the
#                  aer_fifo targets (all, prove, bmc, cover, prove_d4,
#                  clean), with npu_regbank.mk or with ecc.mk, and the sby
#                  working directories are all named lif_ctrl_*.
#
# This job exists because the LIF datapath's golden-model lockstep does
# not constrain the control interface at all: five independent mutants of
# ev_ready, tick_ready, the state_clr priority and the held-spike
# interaction survived the entire lockstep suite. See the header of
# formal/lif_ctrl_props.v.

# Tool discovery, house convention (prefer sby on PATH, then the known
# rootless oss-cad-suite checkouts). Skipped when the including makefile
# has already resolved SBY.
# This fragment's own directory, captured BEFORE the tools.mk include
# below. `$(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))` names the file make is currently
# reading, and an `include` permanently appends the included file to that
# list -- so computing the directory after the include yielded the
# REPOSITORY ROOT, and every standalone `make -C formal -f <block>.mk`
# then ran `cd <repo root> && sby -f <block>.sby`, which fails with
# "No such file or directory". That regression arrived with the toolchain
# pin and is fixed here rather than worked around at the call site; the
# fragment behaved correctly when included from formal/Makefile, because
# there SBY is already set and the include is skipped.
