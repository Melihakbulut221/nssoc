# Formal targets for the fault-tolerance primitives: the SECDED (72, 64)
# weight-SRAM codec and the TMR voter.
#
# Usage, standalone:      make -C formal -f ecc.mk ecc
# Usage, as a fragment:   include ecc.mk   (from formal/Makefile)
#
# Every target name is prefixed and phony, so the fragment cannot collide
# with the aer_fifo targets (all, prove, bmc, cover, prove_d4, clean) or
# with the sby working directories of the same name.
#
# What this fragment does and does not close, against
# docs/09-formal-verification-plan.md:
#
#   target #2, SECDED codec .............. closed by ecc_secded
#   target #4, "TMR voters + resync path"  PARTLY closed by ecc_tmr
#
# Target #4 has three clauses. The two voter clauses - output is always
# majority(a,b,c), and no single corrupted replica can change the output -
# are proven exhaustively here at WIDTH 1, 8 and 32, with the default width
# additionally re-proven on a second engine family (tmr_bmc_abc).
#
# The third clause, "after fault removal, replicas re-converge within N
# cycles (L as bounded safety)", is still not proven by this fragment and
# is not scheduled by it: hw/rtl/tmr_voter.v contains no resynchronization
# path by design, because restoring a faulty replica belongs to the
# protected block, which alone knows how to restore its state.
#
# It is no longer proven NOWHERE, which is what this paragraph said until
# 2026-08-31. The design has exactly one resynchronization path and it is
# in hw/rtl/aer_fifo.v, not in a file this fragment reads: the queue's
# pointer domain computes its next state once from the VOTED value and
# loads it unconditionally into all three replicas, so a replica corrupted
# at any time is rewritten from the vote on the next edge.
# formal/aer_fifo.sby's `resync` and `resync_cover` tasks prove exactly
# that, from an arbitrary already-diverged replica set with the fault
# removed, with N = 1. The configuration domain of hw/rtl/pilot_top.v
# still has none -- its banks hold their own state and are restored by a
# host rewrite, as that file says -- and formal/tmr_voter_cfg.mk proves
# the masking and the storage round-trip there without claiming a resync
# it does not have.
#
# So "ecc PASSes" still means the voter theorem holds and nothing more.
# Target #4 is closed for #4a, and #4b is closed for the queue pointer
# domain and open for the configuration domain.

# Tool discovery, house convention (prefer sby on PATH, then the known
# rootless oss-cad-suite checkouts). Skipped when the including makefile
# has already resolved SBY.
# This fragment's own directory, captured BEFORE the tools.mk include
# below. `$(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))` names the file make is currently
# reading, and an `include` permanently appends the included file to that
# list -- so computing the directory after the include yielded the
# REPOSITORY ROOT, and every standalone `make -C formal -f <block>.mk`
# then ran `cd <repo root> && sby -f <block>.sby`, which fails with
# "No such file or directory". That regression arrived with the toolchain
# pin and is fixed here rather than worked around at the call site; the
# fragment behaved correctly when included from formal/Makefile, because
# there SBY is already set and the include is skipped.
ECC_DIR := $(abspath $(dir $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))))

ifeq ($(origin SBY),undefined)
# Standalone invocation (`make -f <this>.mk ...`) used to rediscover sby
# with a PATH probe and a glob over several oss-cad-suite checkouts. On
# this machine that silently selected a sibling project's toolchain --
# the exact incident tools.mk was written to end, still reachable
# through a documented command. The pin is the single source now; see
# tools.mk, and `make -f tools.mk toolcheck` for what it resolves to.
