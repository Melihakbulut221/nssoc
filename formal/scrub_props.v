// Formal properties for the weight-SRAM ECC scrub controller
// (hw/rtl/scrub.v). SymbiYosys harness: formal/scrub.sby, driver
// formal/scrub.mk. Reference model and lockstep suite:
// hw/tb/test_scrub.py.
//
// Acceptance criteria from docs/09-formal-verification-plan.md, target
// #5, quoted so the scope of this file is unambiguous:
//
//   "Control FSMs (scheduler, multi-pass sequencer, scrub controller,
//    link controllers): deadlock freedom and any-state recovery | No
//    unreachable lockup: from ANY state encoding (including
//    illegal/SEU-corrupted), the FSM reaches a legal safe state within K
//    cycles without asserting outputs that violate bus/interface safety
//    (S+L); state register always in legal set once recovered (S) |
//    IND/BMC with *unconstrained initial state* (reset assumption
//    removed) - the standard any-state trick; bounded recovery via
//    watchdog counter assertion | Full proof per FSM; K documented per
//    FSM (target K <= 16)".
//
// SCOPE. This file discharges the target-#5 obligation for the scrub
// controller, which docs/09 names in the target row and lists first in
// the C.3 priority order. It proves three things that the row asks for
// and one that it does not, and the fourth is the reason this block is
// worth proving at all:
//
//   (a) any-state recovery with K = 1 and the state register always in
//       the legal set once recovered (SC12, SC13, SC14);
//   (b) "without asserting outputs that violate bus/interface safety" --
//       the fault state drives NO memory request, takes no capture and
//       records no fault event (SC15). A scrub controller is a master on
//       a memory port that the rest of the chip depends on; a corrupted
//       one that keeps writing is the only failure in this block that can
//       destroy data irrecoverably, so the fault state is defined by what
//       it does not drive, and that is proven, not commented;
//   (c) deadlock freedom, both structurally (SC16: a stalled state always
//       has a named external cause) and as a bounded-response watchdog
//       (SC17 unconditional for the read-response wait, SC18 for a whole
//       word under an arbiter-fairness assumption);
//   (d) the two properties that make this scrubber safe rather than
//       merely alive: window containment (SC1, SC2 -- the memory-isolation
//       analog of docs/09 target #8's "DMA pointer stays in the configured
//       window", proven here for the scrub master only, NOT for the QSPI
//       streaming path that #8 is about) and writeback discipline (SC3 to
//       SC8 -- a word is rewritten if and only if the immediately
//       preceding granted read of the same address returned a CORRECTED
//       single-bit error; never on a double-bit detection, never on a
//       clean word, never on a timed-out read). Writing back an
//       uncorrectable word turns a detected error into silent permanent
//       corruption, which is the worst outcome available to an ECC
//       subsystem.
//
// NOT in scope, stated so this file cannot be read as more than it is:
// the codec itself (docs/09 target #2, formal/secded.sby), the arbiter
// that issues mem_gnt (target #7 -- no arbiter RTL exists; the fairness
// bound used by SC18 is an ASSUMPTION on the environment here, not a
// proven property of any arbiter), and the QSPI/multi-pass streaming path
// (target #8).
//
// This file is textually included inside the scrub module body under
// `ifdef FORMAL (end of hw/rtl/scrub.v), so it sees state, addr, wd, the
// ev_* event wires and the codewords directly. It is invisible to Icarus
// simulation and to synthesis.
//
// Two optional property sets, each behind its own define so that the
// assumption it needs cannot weaken the tasks that do not want it:
//
//   SCRUB_ANY_STATE (tasks bmc_any, prove_any, cover_any) starts the
//       trace on a corrupted state encoding instead of from reset -- the
//       any-state trick the target names -- and switches OFF the legality
//       invariant SC12, so that k-induction in prove_any starts its
//       induction step from a wholly unconstrained state. S_SAFE is
//       unreachable from reset by construction, which is the point of the
//       encoding, so neither an assertion nor a cover about it means
//       anything in a reset-rooted trace. bmc_any and prove_any are both
//       kept: prove_any is the unbounded result, bmc_any is the one that
//       hands back a counterexample trace when something breaks.
//   SCRUB_LIVENESS (task bmc_live) adds the arbiter-fairness assumption
//       and the whole-word bounded-response watchdog SC18.
//
// The methodology note from formal/lif_ctrl_props.v applies here verbatim
// and is repeated because it decides whether SC13 is real or decorative:
// "the encoding is always legal" (SC12) is itself an assertion, and
// k-induction assumes every assertion at steps 0..k-1 before checking
// step k, so in the prove task the antecedent of the recovery property
// ("if the previous encoding was illegal") is false at every checked
// step. prove therefore reports PASS for a default arm that silently
// resumes in S_IDLE and latches nothing -- exactly the defect SC13 exists
// to catch. Measured on this block, in the same way it was measured on
// lif_core: a mutant whose default arm recovers to S_IDLE, a mutant that
// enters S_SAFE without latching err_cfg, and a mutant whose S_SAFE keeps
// asserting mem_req all PASS bmc and bmc_live; the first two PASS prove
// as well and the third only degrades prove to UNKNOWN, which is a lost
// proof and not a counterexample. All three fail bmc_any and prove_any.
// Do not drop the any-state tasks from the gate on the grounds that prove
// covers them. It does not.
