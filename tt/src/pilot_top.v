// register; the uio nibble is the low four bits of its ID field.
//
// =====================================================================
// 2. Serial host protocol
// =====================================================================
//
// Mode-0 SPI slave (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0), MSB first, one register per
// frame. The slave lives entirely in the clk domain: SER_SCK, SER_CS_N
// and SER_MOSI are two-flop synchronized and edge-detected. Three host
// obligations follow, and all three are real:
//
//   H1. SER_SCK <= clk/4.
//   H2. SER_CS_N falls at least one full SER_SCK period before the first
//       SER_SCK edge. The frame-start reset has to clear the
//       synchronizer before the first sampled clock edge arrives; a host
//       that drops the select and clocks immediately risks losing the
//       first command bit. The same trap is recorded in the sibling
//       project's shipped submission.
//   H3. SER_CS_N stays high at least one full SER_SCK period BETWEEN
//       frames. The bit counter is held at zero only while the
//       synchronized select reads inactive, so a deselect that is never
//       seen leaves the counter running and the next frame decodes at
//       the wrong offset. Found during this pilot's bring-up with a
//       half-period gap; hw/tb/test_pilot_top.py holds the boundary.
//
// Frame: 40 SER_SCK cycles.
//
//   bits 39..32   command byte { WR, ADDR[6:0] }, WR = 1 writes
//   bits 31..0    register data, MSB first
//
// ADDR[6:0] is the regmap byte offset shifted right by two, i.e. the
// register's word index. Every offset in regmap/regmap.yaml is below
// 0x100, so the whole map is reachable in seven bits.
//
// Reads: the addressed register is captured when the command byte
// completes and shifted out on the following falling edges, so the host
// samples data bit 31 on SER_SCK cycle 9. Read side effects (the EVQ_OUT
// pop) happen once, at that capture. Writes commit on the 40th rising
// edge, not at CS_N release, so an aborted frame changes nothing.
//
// =====================================================================
// 3. Register subset
// =====================================================================
//
// Implemented from regmap/regmap.yaml (docs/10 section 10):
//
//   ID VERSION SCRATCH CTRL STATUS STATUS_CLR CFG_NEUR CFG_AXON
//   CFG_THRESH CFG_VRESET CFG_LEAK CFG_SYNSHIFT CFG_REFR CFG_FLAGS
//   PASS_TILE_OFF W_ADDR W_DATA_LO W_DATA_HI N_ADDR N_DATA CNT_SEC
//   CNT_DED CNT_EVQ_OVF CNT_AXON_OOR FAULT_ADDR ECC_INJ FAULT_CLR
//   EVQ_STAT EVQ_IN EVQ_OUT NODE_ID
//
// Not implemented in the pilot: W_BASE and PASS_ID (both are multi-pass
// sequencer bookkeeping with no hardware effect in a single-pass build,
// docs/10 section 9). They read as zero and reject writes like any other
// unmapped offset.
//
// Deliberate, documented deviations from the full block:
//
//   D1. Fault counters are CNT_W bits wide (default 8), not 32, and
//       saturate. Reads zero-extend to 32 bits. Four 32-bit counters
//       would cost about 11,000 um2 on sg13g2 -- an eighth of a 2x2
//       tile budget -- to count events a pilot reads out every few
//       seconds. CNT_EVQ_OVF is the EVQ_IN drop counter of aer_fifo,
//       whose DROP_W is set to CNT_W for the same reason.
//   D2. CFG_NEUR is read-only and reports N_NEURONS. lif_core carries no
//       runtime active-neuron count by design (see its header): a
//       runtime CFG_NEUR would be RTL with no golden reference. CFG_AXON
//       is fully writable and does drive the docs/10 section 6 drop rule.
//   D3. W_ADDR is a weight-word index, not a byte address, and counts
//       0 .. N_AXONS*N_NEURONS/16 - 1. It auto-increments on W_DATA_HI
//       commit exactly as regmap.yaml specifies.
//   D4. W_DATA_LO / W_DATA_HI are not a write-only staging pair here:
//       together with an eight-bit check field they ARE the physical
//       ECC-protected word (section 5). An injected upset is therefore
//       visible when they are read back, and disappears after a scrub.
//       That is the demonstrator, not an accident.
//   D5. Four registers outside regmap.yaml occupy the unmapped region
//       of the same 4 KB window (section 5). They are pilot-only
//       observability and do not change the register-map contract.
//
// =====================================================================
// 4. Datapath
// =====================================================================
//
// Weight load, per 16-weight word (docs/10 section 5 packing: weight k
// of word w is data bit range [4k+3:4k], linear index 16w + k,
// axon-major):
//
//   W_DATA_LO / W_DATA_HI written  ->  data field of the stored word
//   W_DATA_HI commit               ->  check field = secded_enc(data),
//                                      then the armed ECC_INJ pattern is
//                                      XORed into the stored 72-bit word
//   next cycle                     ->  secded_dec runs, CNT_SEC / CNT_DED
//                                      update, FAULT_ADDR latches W_ADDR
//                                      on DED, and the loader writes 16
//                                      weights into lif_core -- always
//                                      the DECODED word, so a correctable
//                                      upset never reaches the datapath,
//                                      or all zeros if the word was
//                                      uncorrectable (E10, docs/10
//                                      section 11.2)
//
// The stored word keeps its injected error, so a bench can re-check it
// with the SCRUB_STB pin as many times as it likes. With CTRL.SCRUB_EN
// set (its reset value) a correctable word is written back repaired on
// every check, which is the scrubber loop of docs/10 section 11.2 at
// pilot scale.
//
// Event path:
//
//   EVQ_IN  <- serial EVQ_IN writes and the AER_IN_STB pin
//   dispatcher pops one word and decodes docs/10 section 7.1 TYPE:
//     00 SPIKE  ID >= CFG_AXON -> dropped, CNT_AXON_OOR++ (section 6)
//               otherwise      -> lif_core synaptic event
//     01 TICK   -> lif_core tick
//     10 SYNC   -> held until lif_core is idle, then echoed into EVQ_OUT
//                  and STATUS.SYNC_DONE is set (section 7.1 barrier)
//     11        -> dropped; the register map defines no counter for it
//   EVQ_OUT <- lif_core spikes (held, not dropped: lif_core keeps a
//              refused spike in out_pend and re-presents it, so the
//              write is retried, never lost) and SYNC echoes (a
//              one-shot pulse, so a refused echo IS lost -- section
//              5.1), drained through a one-deep holding register
//              shared by the AER_OUT pins and the serial EVQ_OUT read.
//
// That holding register is not a buffer for its own sake: it is the
// one-entry show-ahead adapter that turns a registered-output queue into
// the single-access pop the register map defines. Section 8.
//
// Configuration TMR domain (docs/10 section 11.4): every configuration
// bit that reaches lif_core is held in three replicas and voted by
// tmr_voter before it leaves this module. Software reads the voted
// value, so a masked upset is invisible to it; CNT_TMR and the TMR pin
// make it visible to the operator. TMR_INJ emulates an upset on one
// replica's read path. The storage flops are not disturbed, so no
// replica resynchronization is implemented -- consistent with
// tmr_voter.v's header, which leaves resynchronization to the protected
// block.
//
// =====================================================================
// 5. Pilot-only registers (D5)
// =====================================================================
//
//   0x0A0 ECC_INJ_POS  RW  POS[6:0], the codeword bit that
//                          ECC_INJ.SINGLE flips. ECC_INJ.DOUBLE flips
//                          POS and its neighbour (POS + 1 mod 72), which
//                          is a valid double error for any Hsiao code.
//                          Reset 0, so an ECC_INJ write alone is already
//                          deterministic.
//   0x0A4 TMR_INJ      RW  { REP[1:0] at [9:8], BIT[5:0] at [5:0] }

//                          10 = replica B, 11 = replica C; BIT selects a
//                          bit of the voted configuration vector.
//   0x0A8 CNT_TMR      RO  saturating count of voter disagreement
//                          episodes (one per rising edge of mismatch),
//                          cleared by FAULT_CLR bit 5.
//   0x0AC CNT_EVQ_OUT_OVF
//                      RO  saturating count of OUTPUT-queue writes that
//                          were refused and lost. Cleared by FAULT_CLR
//                          bit 6. Section 5.1 is why this register
//                          exists, why it is pilot-only, and why it is
//                          NOT aer_fifo's own drop counter.
//   0x0B0 CNT_EVQ_PAR  RO  saturating count of queue entries DISCARDED
//                          because the stored word failed its entry
//                          parity check, both queue instances in one
//                          count. Cleared by FAULT_CLR bit 7. Section
//                          5.2 is why it exists and why it is one
//                          counter and not two.
//
// FAULT_CLR bits 5, 6 and 7 are pilot-only objects of this section and
// they are allocated the same way as the registers
// above: from space the architecture register map leaves unassigned.
// regmap/regmap.yaml is the
// single source of truth for FAULT_CLR and it allocates exactly five
// bits, b0 CNT_SEC, b1 CNT_DED, b2 CNT_EVQ_OVF, b3 CNT_AXON_OOR, b4
// FAULT_ADDR, with "bits [31:5] ignored". All five are implemented here
// with the meaning the map gives them -- b4 clears FAULT_ADDR, it does
// NOT clear CNT_TMR -- and every position is read from the generated
// header, with an elaboration guard that fires if the map renumbers
// them. CNT_TMR is not in the map, so its clear cannot be either; b5 is
// the first free bit and is inert in the architecture block, so one
// FAULT_CLR write of 0x3F clears everything in either implementation.
// CNT_EVQ_OUT_OVF takes b6 on the same argument and CNT_EVQ_PAR takes
// b7, so the portable clear-everything write is now 0xFF.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// 5.1 Why EVQ_OUT gets its own counter, and why it is not fo_drop
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The fault-injection campaign (docs/16 section 5.2) found one pointer
// injection that raised STATUS.OVF_SEEN while CNT_EVQ_OVF still read
// zero: the overflow was on the OUTPUT queue and only the input queue's
// drop counter is exposed. The obvious repair is to stop sinking
// u_evq_out's drop_cnt (`fo_drop`) and give it a register. That repair
// is wrong, and the reason is measured rather than argued.
//
// aer_fifo counts `wr_en && full` -- a REFUSED write. Its header is
// explicit that this is EVQ_IN semantics, where the software port
// presents a word once and loses it: "a link-side producer gets lossless
// backpressure by gating wr_en with !full". EVQ_OUT's producers are not
// that. lif_core holds a refused spike in out_pend and re-presents it on
// every subsequent cycle until out_ready, so `fo_wr_en` stays high for
// the whole stall and aer_fifo counts one "drop" per CLOCK CYCLE of
// ordinary backpressure while losing nothing at all. Measured on this
// design [fact]: 8 x 8 with EVQ_OUT_DEPTH = 4, one SPIKE event that
// fires all eight neurons, host not draining -- fo_drop reaches 223 and
// is heading for its 255 saturation, and every one of the eight spikes
// is eventually delivered. Publishing that number as an event-loss count
// would be worse than publishing nothing. The original sink was right;
// only the reason recorded next to it was incomplete.
//
// The same measurement condemns the sticky. Until now STATUS.OVF_SEEN
// was set by `fo_wr_en && fo_full`, so the run above also latched
// OVF_SEEN and lit the ERR pin with no event lost and no upset present.
// That contradicts regmap/regmap.yaml, which defines the bit as "at
// least one software-port event dropped at a full input queue", and a
// fault pin that lights during ordinary bursty inference is a pin an
// operator learns to ignore. No existing test caught it because the
// end-to-end harness drains after every command, which its own docstring
// says is deliberate.
//
// So the question is not "which register does fo_drop deserve" but "what
// does EVQ_OUT actually lose". Exactly one writer can lose a word:
//
//   lif_core spikes  cannot be lost at the write port. out_pend holds
//                    the spike and lif_core's busy output includes
//                    out_pend, so the write is retried, not dropped.
//   SYNC echo        CAN be lost. sync_push is a one-shot pulse: the
//                    dispatcher qualifies the D_ISSUE decision with
//                    !fo_full, but the write lands one cycle later, and
//                    if the queue reports full in that cycle the echo is
//                    gone with no retry. Under normal operation the
//                    guard is airtight -- the decision also requires
//                    !lif_busy, which forbids any lif_core write in the
//                    same or the next cycle, so fo_full cannot change
//                    underneath it. It is breakable only by an upset to
//                    the queue pointers in that one cycle, which is
//                    precisely the class docs/16 section 5.2 measures.
//
// A lost SYNC echo is the worst-shaped fault in this block: sticky_sync
// is set from the same pulse, so STATUS.SYNC_DONE reports the barrier
// complete while the barrier word the host is waiting for never arrives.
// That is a fault the chip announces and could not quantify, which is
// the defect docs/16 named. `evqo_drop = sync_push && fo_full` is
// therefore both the counter's increment and the output-queue term of
// STATUS.OVF_SEEN, and the backpressure term is gone from both.
//
// Two costs, stated rather than hidden:
//
//   - the campaign's one flagged pointer injection was flagged by the
//     backpressure term, so with this change it is no longer flagged.
//     That is not a loss of coverage: the term also fired on a clean
//     run, so it carried no information about the upset [fact].
//   - an upset that clears `full` while the queue really is full makes
//     aer_fifo accept and OVERWRITE a stored word. That is a genuine
//     EVQ_OUT event loss and this counter cannot see it, because no
//     write was refused. It is a read/write pointer integrity problem
//     and it belongs to pointer protection, not to a drop counter.
//
// Pilot-only rather than an entry in regmap/regmap.yaml, for three
// reasons. The architecture block cannot lose a SYNC echo any more than
// this one can outside an upset, so every mesh node would carry a
// counter for a condition its own map calls impossible. The fault block
// is contiguous from 0x70 to 0x88, so a new counter lands at 0x8C and
// the checked convention "one clear bit per fault-block register in
// offset order" (sw/tests/test_regmap.py) would hand it FAULT_CLR bit 5
// -- the bit the pilot already spends on CNT_TMR -- renumbering CNT_TMR
// and breaking the portable clear write that regmap.yaml's own FAULT_CLR
// description promises. And the YAML edit would pull in
// sw/golden/secded.py, docs/10 section 10 and hw/rtl/npu_regbank.v for a
// register whose whole content is a pilot measurement. CNT_TMR set the
// precedent for exactly this shape and this register follows it.
//
// Unlike CNT_EVQ_OVF, this counter lives in this module's register
// process on rst_n, not inside aer_fifo on blk_rst_n. docs/16 section
// 5.1 records the consequence of the other arrangement: CTRL.SOFT_RST --
// the recovery for this very fault -- zeroes CNT_EVQ_OVF while
// STATUS.OVF_SEEN stays set, leaving the telemetry self-inconsistent.
// The counter and its sticky share a reset domain here, so a recovery
// cannot make them disagree.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// 5.2 CNT_EVQ_PAR: one counter for two queues, and why
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// hw/rtl/aer_fifo.v stores one even-parity bit per queue entry and
// checks it on the read. A failed check DISCARDS the entry: the read
// pointer still advances, rd_valid is held low, and `par_err` says that
// is what happened. Until now this module connected par_err to nothing,
// so the discard reached the host only through the consumer's bounded
// wait -- fetch_expire for EVQ_IN, oh_expire for EVQ_OUT -- which
// latches STATUS.ERR_CFG and says "a configuration fault happened here"
// for what is in fact an integrity discard. docs/29 section 8 item 5
// named that and explicitly left it to this file.
//
// That is the same defect commit 2d59ec2 fixed for the lif_core memory
// ECC, in the same shape: a mechanism did its work, and the evidence
// went to no register and no pin. For a part whose stated purpose is
// measuring the upset environment, an unreported correction -- or here,
// an unreported detected loss -- is indistinguishable from no upset.
//
// ONE counter for both instances, not one each, and the precedent is
// the pointer telemetry twelve lines below rather than section 5.1:
//
//   CNT_TMR already merges fi_ptr_mm and fo_ptr_mm into a single
//   episode count, because a corrected pointer upset is the same event
//   with the same consequence whichever queue it happened in, and the
//   operator's question is about the environment rather than about the
//   instance. A parity discard is that shape exactly: one stored event
//   lost, announced through a bounded wait, in a 16-bit word of the
//   same width in both queues.
//
//   Section 5.1 split EVQ_OUT off from CNT_EVQ_OVF for the opposite
//   reason, and the difference is real: `wr_en && full` MEANS something
//   different in the two instances -- refused software writes in one,
//   ordinary lossless backpressure cycles in the other -- so one
//   register could not have carried both without publishing a number
//   that is not an event-loss count. par_err carries no such asymmetry.
//   Both instances produce it from `rd_ok && head_bad`, and in both it
//   is one event that existed and no longer does.
//
//   The instance distinction is not free: a second CNT_W counter, a
//   second register offset, a second FAULT_CLR bit, and a second entry
//   in every document and test that lists the map. That is 8 more
//   flip-flops to answer a question no operator action depends on --
//   the recovery for either is the same, and a host that wants the
//   instance can already read EVQ_STAT and STATUS. Two counters would
//   also break the symmetry with CNT_TMR, which is the register a host
//   reads next to this one.
//
// Counted on the rising edge of `fi_par_err || fo_par_err`, so a
// discard that persists across cycles counts once and simultaneous
// discards in the two queues count once -- the same episode convention
// CNT_TMR uses and stated in the same words, because a host that reads
// them side by side must not have to remember two conventions.
//
// The edge register sits in the fault-counter process on rst_n rather
// than on blk_rst_n, so CTRL.SOFT_RST -- the recovery for exactly this
// class of fault -- cannot erase the record that it happened. Same
// arrangement, same reason, as CNT_TMR and CNT_EVQ_OUT_OVF.
//
// It does NOT latch a sticky of its own, and that is deliberate rather
// than an omission. Every discard already reaches STATUS.ERR_CFG
// through the bounded wait that the suppressed rd_valid triggers --
// measured, docs/29 section 5: all seven discards moved status 0x06 ->
// 0x16 -- so a second sticky would report the same event twice, and
// there is no free STATUS bit to spend on it. What was missing was
// never the alarm; it was the distinction between "the queue lost an
// event to a configuration fault" and "the queue discarded a corrupted
// entry", and a counter is exactly that distinction.
//
// Pilot-only, on section 5.1's three arguments unchanged. The fault
// block of regmap/regmap.yaml is contiguous from 0x70 to 0x88, so a
// promoted counter lands at 0x8C and the checked convention "one clear
// bit per fault-block register in offset order" (sw/tests/test_regmap.py)
// hands it FAULT_CLR bit 5 -- the bit the pilot already spends on
// CNT_TMR -- renumbering CNT_TMR and CNT_EVQ_OUT_OVF and breaking the
// portable clear write that regmap.yaml's own FAULT_CLR description
// promises. Deviation D5 covers it and docs/15's D5 row is the record.
//
// =====================================================================
// 6. Geometry
// =====================================================================
//
// N_NEURONS and N_AXONS are elaboration parameters. The default 8 x 8 is
// the geometry measured to fit the recommended tile count in
// docs/15-pilot-tile-plan.md; that document also carries the measured
// area of the alternatives. Constraints, all guarded below: both powers
// of two, both in [4, 16] so the uio nibbles address them exactly, and
// at least 32 synapses so the weight word index is at least one bit.
//
// The parameter defaults are additionally overridable by macro. The
// Tiny Tapeout top level cannot carry parameters, and Icarus only
// applies -P to a root module, so a geometry sweep of the wrapped design
// has no other handle; the same macros are what a LibreLane
// VERILOG_DEFINES entry would set. Parameters remain the primary
// interface for anything that instantiates pilot_top directly.
//
// =====================================================================
// 7. Fault visibility: STATUS.ERR_CFG and the ERR pin
// =====================================================================
//
// STATUS.ERR_CFG is the OR of two level signals, and the ERR pin is that
// OR again with STATUS.OVF_SEEN. The two sources clear differently, so
// they are kept apart in the RTL rather than merged into one flop:
//
//   sticky_errcfg  configuration faults raised in this module: a write
//                  to a configuration-locked register while BUSY, and a
//                  configuration outside its legal range with CTRL.EN
//                  set (docs/10 section 6). Cleared by STATUS_CLR.
//   lif_err_cfg    lif_core's err_cfg output. The neuron core's control
//                  FSM uses a Hamming-distance-2 state encoding; a
//                  single-bit upset in that register lands on a word no
//                  legal transition can produce, the core parks in
//                  S_SAFE and latches this flag (docs/10 section 11.4).
//                  That is the single-event-upset signature this pilot
//                  exists to demonstrate, so it reaches the host and the
//                  ERR pin unconditionally.
//
// The second source is both ORed in live and latched into the first, and
// each half does a job the other cannot:
//
//   live    while the core is parked, STATUS_CLR cannot clear the bit.
//           Reporting a fault as gone while the core is still parked and
//           refusing work would be worse than not reporting it at all.
//   latched CTRL.SOFT_RST is the recovery for this fault -- it resets
//           the queues, the dispatcher and lif_core, the FSM returns to
//           S_IDLE, err_cfg drops, and the neuron state file survives
//           because it is not on the reset net. Without the latch the
//           recovery would also erase the evidence, and an operator who
//           recovers before polling would never learn an upset happened.
//           After the reset the bit is a plain sticky and STATUS_CLR
//           clears it, which is the operator saying "recorded".
//
// A parked core is also permanently BUSY, so the configuration lock will
// latch the first source on the next configuration write as well; that
// is a consequence, not a second fault.
//
// =====================================================================
// 8. EVQ_OUT queue contract (why there is a holding register)
// =====================================================================
//
// hw/rtl/aer_fifo.v is a registered-output queue: rd_data appears one
// cycle AFTER an accepted read, flagged by a one-cycle rd_valid. The
// register-map view of EVQ_OUT is the opposite shape -- read one word,
// see VALID and EVENT in the same access -- and hw/rtl/npu_regbank.v
// states that as convention C9: its hw_evq_out_* inputs must be
// show-ahead (first-word-fall-through).
//
// Three ways to close that gap were considered:
//
//   (a) a show-ahead read port on aer_fifo. Rejected: a combinational
//       read of mem[] makes the storage an asynchronous-read register
//       file, which no synchronous SRAM macro can implement, so the
//       queue could never be retargeted to a macro at NPU scale. It
//       would also invalidate the four proofs that hold today.
//   (b) a one-entry adapter between the queue and the register view.
//       Chosen.
//   (c) relaxing npu_regbank's expectation to the registered shape.
//       Rejected: it pushes a two-access read protocol into the
//       architecture register map, which regmap/regmap.yaml defines as a
//       single-access pop.
//
// oh_valid / oh_data / oh_pop below ARE that adapter, and they are the
// reference implementation of C9 for this repository: oh_valid means a
// word is presented now (and since 2026-08-30 it is a checked pair of
// rails rather than a flip-flop -- section 8.2), oh_data is that word,
// both hold until a pop
// (a serial EVQ_OUT read or an AER_OUT_ACK edge), and the queue advances
// behind them. EVQ_STAT.OUT_FILL counts the held word, so the fill level
// a host reads is the number of events it can still get out. The cost is
// one event per three clock cycles of drain bandwidth, far above what
// either observer can consume. Nothing here reads aer_fifo's rd_data
// combinationally, so the queue stays retargetable.
//
// oh_req is the adapter's "a read is outstanding" flag, and it is the
// second structure in this module that can wait forever. It is set only
// together with fo_rd_en and cleared only by fo_rd_valid, so a
// single-bit upset that sets it with no read outstanding waits for a
// grant that will never be requested: the arming condition below is
// gated on !oh_req, so no further read is ever issued, EVQ_OUT never
// advances again, and the queue fills. lif_core then holds its next
// spike against a full queue, STATUS.BUSY stays high and nothing is
// flagged. Unlike the ordinary full-queue backpressure this looks like,
// the host cannot clear it by reading EVQ_OUT -- oh_valid is low, so a
// read pops nothing -- so only CTRL.SOFT_RST or a reset recovers it.
// That is the same silent-hang failure class as the D_FETCH wait of
// section 5.1 in docs/16, reached from a different flip-flop, and it is
// measured: the fault-injection campaign's `evq_hold` group hits it from
// a deposit into oh_req.
//
// It gets the same treatment. A granted read answers in one cycle, so
// OH_WAIT_MAX = 63 cycles of waiting is far past any legitimate reply;
// past it the adapter clears oh_req, re-arms on the next cycle and
// latches sticky_errcfg on that same edge, exactly as the dispatcher's
// bounded wait does. Nothing is lost by the recovery: oh_req without a
// read outstanding is by construction a state in which the queue has
// dequeued nothing, so the re-armed read fetches the word that was next
// all along.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// 8.1 Why the two expiry terms are wires and not one-cycle pulses
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Until 2026-08-30 each bounded wait reported through a one-bit pulse
// register -- fetch_timeout and oh_timeout -- set for exactly one cycle
// when the wait expired, and sampled by the register process on the
// following edge to latch sticky_errcfg. The wait counters and the
// pulses were injected into and the result is docs/16 section 5.8:
//
//   * the COUNTERS are sound, and structurally so. A monotone increment
//     compared for equality against its all-ones maximum reaches that
//     value from every state, and no single flip from zero can reach
//     it, so an upset in a counter delays or advances the expiry but
//     cannot abolish it. Twelve of twelve injections masked. They are
//     left alone; TMR on them would buy nothing.
//   * the PULSES were the weakness, in both directions. Set by an
//     upset, a pulse fabricated a configuration error that had not
//     happened -- six of six random-phase injections, every one of them
//     a clean run reported as faulty. Cleared by an upset during the
//     single cycle it was high, it erased the report entirely: the
//     deadlock happened, the bounded wait recovered it, the run
//     returned a wrong answer, and STATUS read 0x06 with every counter
//     zero and the ERR pin low, against a control injected at the same
//     cycle with byte-identical wrong output that read 0x16.
//
// The repair removes the state rather than protecting it. fetch_expire
// and oh_expire are combinational terms, and the same wire both ends
// the wait and latches sticky_errcfg, on one edge. There is no cycle in
// which the report exists as separate storage, so there is nothing for
// a single upset to set or clear: an upset must now corrupt the
// counter, which is the part that was measured sound, or sticky_errcfg
// itself, which every sticky in this module shares and which the
// campaign covers as its own target. Cost: minus two flip-flops.
//
// Duplicate-and-OR on the pulses was the alternative, at plus two
// flip-flops, and it closes only the erased direction -- an OR of two
// copies still fabricates when either copy is set. It is the fallback
// if the combinational form ever becomes unacceptable, and nothing here
// suggests it is: the terms are three-input ANDs of registers that
// already drive control logic on the same edge.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// 8.2 Why oh_valid is two rails and not three replicas
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// docs/16 section 6.2 ranked the show-ahead adapter first for wave 6 on
// benefit per flip-flop, and the concentration is real: of the group's
// six silent-corruption records, four sit in two one-bit valid flags
// (oh_valid here, and u_evq_out.rd_valid in hw/rtl/aer_fifo.v), 2 of 2
// each. A valid flag upset fabricates an event out of stale oh_data or
// drops the one it was holding, and no consumer downstream can tell
// either from a real spike.
//
// The proposal there was to triplicate them on the aer_ptr_bank
// pattern. THAT PATTERN DOES NOT REACH ONE BIT, and the reason is a
// proof rather than a measurement. Section 9 records what the merge
// hazard costs and what defeats it: three replicas written from the
// same expression are provably equivalent, opt_dff normalises them and
// opt_merge hashes them into one, and what holds them apart without
// depending on any attribute is that each replica stores a DIFFERENT
// FUNCTION of the value. Over a value of one bit there are exactly two
// storage functions -- x and ~x. Two replicas can take one each. A
// third has nothing left to take, and whichever function it picks it
// is bit-for-bit identical to one of the other two. Section 9's
// measured result for the 55-bit configuration word is the same
// statement one step up: POL alone gave two distinct functions there
// too, replica C collapsed under a forced flatten, and it took the MIX
// layer -- which needs at least four bits to give every stored bit a
// weight of two or three -- to give C a function of its own. There is
// no MIX at one bit.
//
// So the options for a single flag are: three replicas held apart by
// keep_hierarchy ALONE, which this repository has twice decided is not
// enough (section 9, and docs/20 section 11); or four bits of unrelated
// state bundled into one W >= 4 bank so that MIX applies, at +8
// flip-flops for this one flag's two records; or two rails, at +1.
//
// Two rails it is, and what they buy is stated exactly: an upset in
// either rail is DETECTED, not corrected. The rails disagree, the
// adapter presents nothing rather than presenting a word it can no
// longer vouch for, sticky_errcfg latches and the ERR pin lights.
// The held event is still lost -- the run is still wrong -- but it is
// wrong LOUDLY, which is the whole difference between the SDC class
// and the DETECTED class in docs/16, and it is the same difference
// section 8.1 above is about. The disagreement heals on the next clock
// edge: the rails take a next VALUE rather than an enable, and that
// value is written from the CHECKED flag, which reads 0 while they
// disagree, so the safe reading becomes the stored one and a second
// upset cannot land on top of the first.
//
// One caveat that belongs here rather than in the rail module, because
// it is about the CALLER: a next-value rail is only correct when every
// term of that next value is X-free. hw/rtl/lif_core.v's copy of this
// rail takes an enable instead, for exactly that reason, and its
// header carries the measurement. oh_valid's next value is built from
// fo_rd_valid, oh_valid and oh_pop, all defined out of reset, so the
// next-value form is safe here.
//
// Cost: +1 flip-flop, one XOR of two rails, and one term in the fault
// process. The other two flags of the same class are in files this
// change does not own -- u_evq_out.rd_valid in aer_fifo.v and out_pend
// in lif_core.v -- and the same two-rail construction applies to each
// at the same price.
//
// =====================================================================
// 9. Configuration TMR: why the replicas are submodules, not three regs
// =====================================================================
//
// Until 2026-08-26 the three 55-bit replicas of the configuration TMR
// domain were three `reg [TMR_W-1:0]` vectors (cfg_a, cfg_b, cfg_c) in
// this module's register process, written from the same expression on
// the same cycle. That is correct RTL and it is a defect in silicon.
// It takes two yosys passes, which is why a single-pass reading of the
// tool missed it: `opt_dff` first rewrites each bank's hold-mux into an
// enable flip-flop, which erases the only structural difference between
// them, and `opt_merge` then hashes the three now-identical cells into
// one and rewires the other two names to it. Bisected on this design:
// `opt_merge` alone leaves all 1161 declared flip-flops standing, and
// `opt_dff; opt_merge` takes it to 1045 [fact].
// Measured on the artifact that fed the 4x2 harden,
// tt/runs/tt-harden/06-yosys-synthesis/tt_um_melihakbulut_nssoc.nl.v:
// 362 references to `cfg_a[` and zero to `cfg_b[` or `cfg_c[` [fact].
// The voter therefore read one physical bank three times; a real upset
// corrupted all three inputs together and the majority vote returned the
// corrupted value. RTL fault injection (docs/16) cannot see this,
// because at RTL the three vectors are still distinct signals.
//
// Four mechanisms were considered. Every number below is measured with
// Yosys 0.33 on sg13g2, `synth -flatten` + dfflibmap + abc, whole
// design; the pre-fix reference point is 1045 flip-flops and the RTL
// declares 1161.
//
//   (a) `(* keep *)` on the three regs. REJECTED, and it is worse than
//       useless because it looks like it works. Measured: flip-flop
//       count unchanged at 1045, and the netlist now contains 110
//       references to `cfg_b[` -- all of them of the form
//       `assign \u_pilot.cfg_b[3] = \u_pilot.cfg_a[3] ;` [fact]. The
//       attribute lands on the wire, not on the flip-flop cell, so
//       opt_clean preserves the name while opt_merge still deletes the
//       storage. This is why the guard test counts flip-flops and never
//       greps for a signal name.
//   (b) `(* syn_keep *)`. REJECTED: it is a vendor attribute for
//       Synplify/Vivado front ends and Yosys ignores it outright.
//       Measured: 1045 flip-flops and zero references to `cfg_b[` in
//       the netlist, so unlike (a) it does not even leave a name behind
//       [fact].
//   (c) one module per replica plus `(* keep_hierarchy *)`. CHOSEN as
//       the primary mechanism. `flatten` skips modules carrying the
//       attribute, and `opt_merge` does not merge instances of
//       user-defined modules unless it is asked with `-share_all`, so
//       the three banks are two independent steps away from collapse
//       rather than one. It is the same M-4 recipe the sibling
//       rad-hard programme validated through LibreLane after its own
//       constant-folding loss (its docs/20 finding F-1).
//   (d) an architectural difference that makes the three genuinely
//       non-equivalent to structural hashing. ADDED ON TOP of (c),
//       because (c) is still one tool honouring one attribute. Each
//       bank takes a POL parameter and stores `value ^ POL`, presenting
//       `bits ^ POL` at its output: replica A stores the value true
//       (POL = 0), replica B stores its exact complement (POL = all
//       ones) and replica C stores it with the odd bits complemented
//       (POL = 0x2AAAAAAAAAAAAA). Two consequences, both intended:
//         - the three instances carry different parameters, so Yosys
//           derives three different module types and nothing can hash
//           them together even with `-share_all`;
//         - if some future flow flattens the hierarchy anyway, bit i of
//           bank A is driven by `x_i` and bit i of bank B by `~x_i`,
//           which are different cells, so at least two physical banks
//           survive a total loss of the attributes. Measured: 110
//           flip-flops under a deliberately forced flatten against 55
//           before this fix [fact].
//       Honest limit, and it is a hard one: only two distinct functions
//       of x_i exist (x_i and ~x_i), so under a forced flatten bank C
//       merges bitwise into A and B and the domain degrades to
//       duplication-with-detection. Measured 2026-08-26 on pinned
//       sources: keep_hierarchy stripped, POL as designed, 1,100
//       flip-flops -- replica C entirely gone [fact]. No assignment of
//       CFG_POL_C avoids this; with three replicas and two polarities
//       one replica always collides bit for bit. Polarity coding
//       cannot do better, and neither can a constant XOR mask, which is
//       the same mechanism spelled differently.
//       Secondary, and tagged as an estimate because this project has
//       no beam data: complementary storage also decorrelates any
//       upset mechanism with a preferred direction (a strike or a
//       total-dose shift that favours 1->0), because the same physical
//       bias lands as the opposite logical error in replica B
//       [estimate].
//   (e) a per-replica STORAGE TRANSFORM that is not a polarity: replica
//       C stores an invertible XOR mixing of the configuration word
//       (MIX = 1), so every one of its 55 stored bits is an XOR of two
//       or three distinct configuration bits. ADDED 2026-08-26 on top
//       of (d), because (d) provably cannot hold a third bank and the
//       header used to claim it could. Nothing of the form
//       `x_i ^ x_j (^ x_k)` equals `x_i` or `~x_i`, so no per-bit hash
//       can match replica C against A or B -- this is a proof, not a
//       measurement, and the measurement agrees: keep_hierarchy
//       stripped, 1,155 flip-flops with no loss at all, in both the
//       ASIC flow and synth_ecp5 [fact].
//       What was evaluated and rejected on the way there:
//         - a per-replica bit ROTATION, the obvious candidate, because
//           `cfg[(i+k) % 55]` is neither `cfg[i]` nor its inverse. It
//           does not work. Structural hashing matches on the
//           flip-flop's (D, EN, reset) signature, not on bit position,
//           so a rotation relabels which cell holds which bit and
//           leaves the SET of stored functions unchanged; the rotated
//           bank hashes into the unrotated one flop for flop. Measured,
//           replica C rotated by 7, keep_hierarchy stripped: 1,100
//           flip-flops, identical to polarity alone [fact].
//         - a per-replica constant XOR MASK. It is a polarity choice by
//           definition, so it is (d) and inherits (d)'s two-function
//           ceiling. Not run; it is the design that was already there.
//       The construction and its inverse are documented at
//       pilot_cfg_bank. Cost, and it is the real objection to answer:
//       mixing means one upset in replica C decodes to two or three
//       wrong bits at its output. That is harmless, because they are
//       all in one replica and a bitwise majority masks every bit on
//       which one replica disagrees, however many. An earlier revision
//       of this header asserted the opposite and used it to conclude
//       that "no encoding can" do better than (d); both halves of that
//       were wrong.
//
// Flow portability, stated plainly rather than assumed:
//
//   (c) is portable across every flow this repository runs, because
//       both of them are yosys: the LibreLane/yosys ASIC flow and the
//       plain `synth_ecp5` FPGA run use the same `flatten` pass, which
//       honours the attribute. It is NOT portable to a front end that
//       does not read yosys attributes. That is a real limit, not a
//       theoretical one, and it is why (d) and (e) exist.
//   (d) and (e) are plain Verilog-2005 and depend on no attribute in
//       any tool. Together they are the layer that still holds when (c)
//       does not, and (e) is the half of it that holds the THIRD bank:
//       (d) on its own bounds the loss at one bank and, as measured
//       above, sits exactly on that bound. Do not read (d) as a
//       standalone fallback; until 2026-08-26 this header did, and it
//       was wrong for the whole of that time.
//   None is trusted. sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py runs both
//       flows, counts the flip-flops in the mapped netlist per replica
//       bank, and fails if any of them collapses. It also strips
//       keep_hierarchy and requires the count to be unchanged, which is
//       the assertion that holds (e) honest. That test -- not any
//       attribute -- is what keeps this fixed, and it is mutation-checked
//       against a scratch copy with the fix removed.
//
// One flow consequence to carry forward. Because (d) parameterises the
// bank, yosys derives three module types whose names begin with
// `$paramod`, and LibreLane's Checker.YosysUnmappedCells counts every
// cell type starting with `$` as an unmapped instance. Under the default
// SYNTH_HIERARCHY_MODE ("flatten") the hardening run would therefore
// abort. scripts/gen_tt_submission.py now emits
// SYNTH_HIERARCHY_MODE = "deferred_flatten", which flattens AFTER the
// banks are standard cells: measured 1155 flip-flops, 55 under each of
// u_cfg_a / u_cfg_b / u_cfg_c, and no `$` cell type left [fact]. Any
// other LibreLane configuration that hardens this module needs the same
// key.
//
// Cost, measured, against the pre-fix design [fact]:
//   sg13g2   1045 -> 1155 flip-flops; 106,174 -> 109,058 um2 (+2.7%)
//            on a 4x2 tile of 268,059 um2
//   ECP5 85F 1045 -> 1155 TRELLIS_FF, 3449 -> 4503 TRELLIS_COMB,
//            Fmax 47.87 -> 46.45 MHz at speed grade 6, seed 0
//            (target 25 MHz, PASS both before and after)
// The LUT growth is larger than the flip-flop growth because the voter
// was not being paid for either: with one physical bank feeding all
// three of its inputs, `(a&b)|(a&c)|(b&c)` folded to a wire.
//

// =====================================================================
// 10. The dispatcher check field: two bits, and what they cover
// =====================================================================
//
// The fault-injection campaign's residual after the queue-storage
// hardening is 11 silent corruptions across four structures, and
// `dispatch` leads at 5 of 18. All five are in this module and all five
// are DATA corruption rather than deadlock, which is what makes this
// wave different in kind from the two the dispatcher has already had --
// docs/16 section 5.1's D_FETCH deadlock, closed with a bounded wait,
// and section 8.1's erasable report pulse, closed by deleting the
// state. Read out of hw/tb/fi_campaign_results.json [fact]:
//
//   dstate bit 0, D_ISSUE -> 2'b10, the illegal code. The default arm
//                 already recovers to D_IDLE, so nothing hangs -- and
//                 the event being issued is dropped on the way, with no
//                 counter, no sticky and no pin. One event lost, run
//                 silently wrong.
//   dstate bit 1, D_FETCH -> D_ISSUE. The worst of the five: 2'b01 and
//                 2'b11 are both LEGAL codes, so nothing anywhere can
//                 tell them apart, and the FSM issues whatever evw
//                 happens to hold. Measured: a spurious event 7 in
//                 place of the real event 2.
//   evw bit 0     the ID field. A spike is delivered to the wrong axon
//                 and the run diverges from the golden model in both
//                 the event stream and the retained neuron state.
//   evw bits 14, 15  the TYPE field. A SPIKE becomes a TICK or a
//                 reserved code; the event is silently dropped or
//                 silently reinterpreted.
//
// So the failure is not "the dispatcher stops", it is "the dispatcher
// acts on a word or a state it should not trust", and no bounded wait
// can see that: a wait fires on an answer that does not arrive, and
// here every answer arrives, on time, wrong.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// 10.1 The one-bit pigeonhole, checked at two bits rather than assumed
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Section 8.2 proves that three replicas cannot be held apart over ONE
// bit: there are exactly two storage functions, x and ~x, and a third
// replica is bit-for-bit identical to one of the other two. dstate is
// two bits, so the bar has to be re-derived rather than carried over.
// It does not clear it, and the derivation is short.
//
// A replica of a two-bit value is two flip-flops, each storing some
// boolean function of the pair, and the replica is only a replica if
// the two functions together determine the value -- that is, if the
// map is a bijection on the four states. Every coordinate function of
// a bijection on two bits is BALANCED (two ones out of four), and there
// are exactly six balanced functions of two variables:
//
//     d0, ~d0, d1, ~d1, d0^d1, ~(d0^d1)
//
// Replica A takes d1 and d0. Replica B, on the polarity transform,
// takes ~d1 and ~d0. Four of the six are now spent, and the two that
// remain -- d0^d1 and its complement -- are complements OF EACH OTHER,
// so a replica built from both stores one bit of information twice and
// determines nothing. There is no third replica. The MIX layer of
// section 9, which rescued the 55-bit configuration domain, is the same
// construction one step up and it does not help here either: over W
// bits the affine transforms give 2*(2^W - 1) coordinate functions, six
// at W = 2, which is the same six.
//
// The bar therefore moves from "one bit" to "fewer than three bits",
// and the general statement is the one section 8.2 should have made:
// triple modular redundancy needs at least six distinct balanced
// storage functions, and a W-bit value has only 2*(2^W - 1) affine ones
// -- 2 at W = 1, 6 at W = 2, 14 at W = 3. Three bits is the first width
// at which a third replica has functions left to take.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// 10.2 What was chosen: two check bits, +2 flip-flops
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Correction is therefore unavailable for dstate at any price this
// design would pay, and detection is what is left. u_disp_chk is one
// pilot_chk_bank instance holding two bits:
//
//   dstate_par = ^dstate. Storing the parity of a 2-bit state next to
//                it makes {dstate, dstate_par} a 3-bit code whose three
//                legal words -- 000 for D_IDLE, 011 for D_FETCH, 110
//                for D_ISSUE -- are pairwise at Hamming distance 2. So
//                EVERY single-bit upset in dstate or in its check bit
//                lands on an illegal word and is detected, including
//                the D_FETCH -> D_ISSUE flip that the two-bit encoding
//                cannot see at all. This is exactly the encoding
//                hw/rtl/lif_core.v gives its own FSM, which the
//                campaign credits with 12 of 12 DETECTED, reached here
//                by adding a check bit rather than by re-encoding --
//                the same cost, +1 flip-flop, and it keeps dstate's
//                three literals and every case arm as they were.
//   evw_par    = ^{evw[15:14], evw[9:0]}, the parity of the twelve bits
//                the dispatcher ACTS on. evw[13:10] is deliberately
//                outside the check: nothing reads those bits (they are
//                in the _unused sink at the bottom of this module), an
//                upset in them is MASKED today, and covering them would
//                convert a harmless upset into a reported fault. A
//                check field must not manufacture alarms for state that
//                does not matter.
//
// The evw check is qualified with `dstate == D_ISSUE` for the same
// reason: outside D_ISSUE the word is about to be overwritten by the
// next capture, an upset in it costs nothing, and the campaign records
// several such injections as MASKED. Checking it unconditionally would
// turn every one of those into a false alarm. The check is applied at
// the one moment the word is used.
//
// One trap in this construction, recorded because the first version of
// it walked straight into it. The two check bits CANNOT both be written
// the same way. dstate is rewritten every edge, so its check bit takes
// a plain next value and a disagreement is one cycle wide -- the
// dual-rail construction of section 8.2, and the combinational term
// reports it on the very edge that heals it. evw is not: it holds its
// word for the whole of D_ISSUE, and a next-value check bit would be
// recomputed from the held word on every edge, so an upset landing IN
// the held word would be recomputed into the check bit one edge later
// and the two would agree on the corrupted event from the second cycle
// onward. The check would then only ever catch an upset in the single
// cycle it arrived, which is a small fraction of the exposure and is
// precisely what the campaign's 3 evw records are outside of. So evw's
// check bit takes an ENABLE, written only when the word is written, and
// stays the parity of the word that was actually captured.
//
// On a failed check, `disp_chk_bad`:
//
//   - the combinational issue is suppressed, so lif_ev_valid,
//     lif_tick_valid and ev_dropped_oor all read low in the same cycle.
//     This matters: a dstate check failure means dstate may READ
//     D_ISSUE while being untrustworthy, and lif_ev_valid is
//     combinational from dstate, so a next-cycle-only recovery would
//     issue the bad event before recovering from it.
//   - the FSM TAKES THE D_IDLE ARM rather than being assigned D_IDLE.
//     That distinction is worth two of the campaign's records and it is
//     the same one docs/16 section 5.8 records for the bounded wait:
//     D_IDLE's arm captures a read answer that arrived in this cycle and
//     re-arms the fetch, while an assignment throws that answer away and
//     turns a reported recovery into a reported recovery WITH a lost
//     event. Measured, the first version of this change assigned the
//     state and two upsets that the design used to absorb harmlessly
//     came back as announced event losses; taking the arm returns both
//     to "announced, nothing lost". The untrusted event is dropped
//     either way -- it is the one whose word or state failed -- and the
//     queue has already dequeued it.
//   - sticky_errcfg latches, on the same clock edge, from the same
//     wire. Section 8.1's rule applies here without amendment: the term
//     is combinational and there is no cycle in which the report exists
//     as separate storage for a second upset to erase or fabricate.
//
// This DETECTS and does not correct, exactly as the dual-rail flags and
// the queue entry parity do, and the claim is the same narrow one: the
// five events are still lost. What changes is that the pilot says so.
//
// The restructure that pays for it: the dispatcher's next state is now
// computed in a combinational block and registered in a separate one,
// because the check bits have to be written from the same next values
// as the registers they cover, on the same edge, or they would drift by
// a cycle and check nothing. The case arms are unchanged line for line.
//
// Cost: +2 flip-flops, one 3-input XOR and one 13-input XOR reduction
// on paths that end at dstate and at lif_core's valid inputs. docs/30
// carries the measured timing.
//
// The merge trap, in its fourth form. These are not replicas, so
// opt_merge has nothing to hash them against -- the hazard is the one
// hw/rtl/lif_core.v's check fields carry and section 3b of
// sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py already names: a check bit is a
// pure FUNCTION of the register it covers in every reachable state, so
// a tool able to reason across sequential state could delete the
// storage, rebuild the bit from the parity tree and leave a checker
// that reports every state legal. Nothing in yosys does that today.
// pilot_chk_bank is a keep_hierarchy module with a (* keep *) register
// for the same reason aer_par_bank is: under deferred_flatten abc
// renumbers every cell before the flatten, so an instance path is the
// only naming that reaches the shipped netlist and can be counted
// there.
//

// The hazard here is NOT opt_merge. A check bit has no twin to be
// hashed against -- that is the pointer replicas' and the valid flags'
// problem, and it is why those modules carry a POL or MIX storage
// transform and this one does not. The hazard is the one every check
// field carries: the stored bit is a pure FUNCTION of the register it
// covers in every reachable state, so a tool able to reason across
// sequential state could delete the storage, rebuild the bit from the
// parity tree, and leave a checker that reports every state legal --
// protection that passes every simulation in this repository and
// detects nothing in silicon. Nothing in yosys does that today. The
// keep_hierarchy attribute, the (* keep *) on the register and the
// netlist guard are three independent answers to the same question,
// and none of them is trusted alone.

//                    for as long as the design is RTLIL the two rails
//                    are a $_DFF_PN0_ and a $_DFF_PN1_ -- different D
//                    net, different reset value -- and structural
//                    hashing has nothing to match with the hierarchy
//                    gone. Plain Verilog-2005; depends on no attribute.
//                    At 55 bits this same layer was measured to hold
//                    the configuration domain's replicas A and B apart
//                    under a forced flatten while the third, which had
//                    no third function available, collapsed. At one bit
//                    there is no third function to want.
//
// What POL is measured to buy, and it is measured rather than argued.
// With EVERY `keep` and `keep_hierarchy` deleted from hw/rtl -- not
// just stripped by attrmap after elaboration -- both the ASIC and the
// ECP5 recipes keep all 1296 flip-flops, no rail and no bank merged.
// Mutating `.POL(1'b1)` on u_ohv_b to `.POL(1'b0)`, which no simulation
// can tell from the original, takes both to 1295: the pair collapses to
// one flip-flop that agrees with itself. Measured 2026-08-31 [fact];
// sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py section 1e is that experiment kept
// running.
//
// What POL does NOT buy, and what the shipped netlist actually holds.
// POL does not reach silicon. The stored reset value is `1'b0 ^ POL`,
// so the POL=1 rail is a flip-flop that resets to 1, and the only
// asynchronous flip-flop dfflibmap will take from sg13g2 is
// sg13g2_dfrbpq, which resets to 0. (The library's one set-capable
// cell, sg13g2_sdfbbp_1, is a scan flop carrying SET_B, RESET_B, SCD
// and SCE; dfflibmap does not use it and prints `unmapped dff cell:
// $_DFF_PN1_`.) It therefore builds the reset-to-1 flop by inverting D
// and Q around a reset-to-0 one, those two inverters land next to this
// module's own `d ^ POL` and `bits ^ POL`, and abc folds each pair to a
// buffer. Measured in the sign-off netlist
// hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/signoff-6x2/final/nl/ [fact]:
//
//   u_ohv_a   1 x sg13g2_dfrbpq_1
//   u_ohv_b   1 x sg13g2_dfrbpq_1, 2 x sg13g2_buf_1
//
// no inverter in either and both storing the flag in true polarity. The
// other two copies of this module land the same way -- u_rdv_a/b in
// each queue instance, u_op_a/b in lif_core, the last pair carrying the
// enable mux2 as well.
//
// That erasure is safe here and it is not a third defence. dfflibmap
// runs after the last pass that could merge anything: LibreLane's
// deferred_flatten performs no optimisation after mapping, which is why
// the measurement above comes out at 1296 either way. But it does mean
// the SHIPPED netlist carries no structural difference between the two
// rails, so a flow that ran a merge pass after technology mapping would
// find two identical dfrbpq cells and only `keep`, keep_hierarchy and
// the netlist census would be standing there. Do not read the two
// flip-flops in the netlist as evidence that POL worked; the
// attribute-stripped synthesis is that evidence, and the netlist census
// in sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py is what would catch the day it
// stops being true.
//
// No portable RTL avoids this at one bit. A rail storing the complement
// of a flag whose safe value is 0 must reset to 1, there being no other
// storage function over one variable to choose (section 8.2), so the
// reset-to-1 flop and dfflibmap's inversion of it are both forced.
// Moving the read-side XOR out to the consumer does not help: the
// inverters dfflibmap adds sit on the same two combinational cones and
// fold against the consumer's just as they fold against this module's.
// docs/33-rail-transform.md records the full measurement.
//
// The port presents `bits ^ POL`, so both rails read in true polarity
// and a reader compares them for EQUALITY. A debugger reading
// u_ohv_b.bits in an RTL simulation sees the complement of the flag, by
// design; in the mapped netlist there is nothing left to see, per the
// paragraph above.
//
// Two rails DETECT and do not correct: the consumer is responsible for
// choosing the safe interpretation of a disagreement and for reporting
// it. hw/rtl/pilot_top.v drops the held event and latches
// sticky_errcfg.
//
// No enable port. The caller drives the hold into d, so both rails are
// rewritten every cycle and a disagreement is exactly one cycle wide
// from any state at all -- which is what lets the consumer's safe
// reading become the stored one, and what keeps the rails out of the
// inductive invariants of the proofs over the other two copies of this
// module (hw/rtl/aer_fifo.v, hw/rtl/lif_core.v).

// pilot_cfg_bank: one physical replica of the configuration TMR domain
// =====================================================================
//
// One instance per replica. The reason this is a module at all, rather
// than a reg vector in pilot_top, is header section 9: three identical
// flip-flop banks written from the same expression are one bank after
// yosys opt_merge, and the voter above them then votes three copies of
// the same corrupted value.
//
// Two independent defences live here and neither is trusted alone:
//
//   keep_hierarchy   `flatten` skips this module, and `opt_merge` does
//                    not merge instances of user-defined modules unless
//                    it is invoked with -share_all. Flow-portable across
//                    the LibreLane/yosys ASIC flow and synth_ecp5, both
//                    of which use the same `flatten` pass; NOT portable
//                    to a front end that does not read yosys attributes,
//                    which is why the storage transform below exists.
//   POL + MIX        the per-replica storage TRANSFORM. Each bank stores
//                    a different function of the configuration word, so
//                    no two banks have a flip-flop with the same
//                    (D, EN, reset) signature and structural hashing has
//                    nothing to match even with the hierarchy gone.
//                    Plain Verilog-2005; depends on no attribute.
//
// The transform, and why it is what it is. What opt_merge hashes is the
// stored FUNCTION, so the question is how many distinct functions of the
// configuration word the three banks present:
//
//   POL alone gives two. A storage bit has exactly two polarities, x_i
//   and ~x_i, so with three replicas one of them always collides
//   bit-for-bit with another. Measured under a forced flatten: 1,100
//   flip-flops, replica C entirely gone [fact]. No choice of POL
//   constant improves this, and a constant XOR mask is the same
//   mechanism under another name -- a per-bit polarity choice -- so it
//   does not either.
//
//   A per-replica bit ROTATION does not help, which is worth stating
//   because it looks like it should. Structural hashing is indifferent
//   to bit position: rotating relabels which physical flip-flop holds
//   which value bit but leaves the SET of stored functions identical, so
//   the rotated bank hashes into the unrotated one flop for flop.
//   Measured, replica C rotated by 7 with POL = 0, forced flatten:
//   1,100 flip-flops -- exactly the polarity result [fact].
//
//   MIX = 1 gives a third function by making every stored bit an XOR of
//   TWO OR THREE distinct configuration bits. Nothing of that form can
//   equal x_i or ~x_i for any i, so replica C is provably
//   non-collidable against A and B rather than measured to be. The map
//   is two unit-triangular XOR layers over GF(2) -- the low half absorbs
//   the high half, then the high half absorbs the mixed low half through
//   a rotation -- which is invertible by construction (a product of two
//   unit-triangular matrices) and whose inverse is the same two layers
//   run backwards. One XOR per bit each way, no adders, no state.
//   Measured, forced flatten: 1,155 flip-flops, no loss at all [fact].
//
// A note on the objection an earlier revision of this header raised
// against exactly this construction -- that mixing turns a single upset
// into a multi-bit error and so defeats the voter. It does turn one
// upset into two or three wrong bits at q, and against a SINGLE fault
// that is free: they are all in ONE replica, which is precisely the
// failure TMR masks. A bitwise majority over three banks corrects every
// bit on which a single replica disagrees, however many bits that is.
// The objection confused a multi-bit error inside one replica with a
// multi-replica error.
//
// What it does cost, stated rather than glossed:
//   - against a DOUBLE fault, two upsets in different replicas are
//     uncorrectable only if they land on the same bit of the voted
//     word, and widening replica C's error from one bit to about three
//     raises that coincidence for a (C, A) or (C, B) pair by about the
//     same factor -- order 3/55 instead of 1/55 [estimate on the
//     factor; the widening itself is fact]. It buys the third replica
//     existing at all, which is a first-order effect traded against a
//     second-order one.
//   - replica C alone can no longer be read out bit-for-bit by a
//     debugger. hw/tb/test_fi_campaign.py deposits into u_cfg_c.bits
//     and its comment on bit positions being preserved by the storage
//     transform is true of A and B and no longer true of C; the
//     campaign still classifies CORRECTED, because the voter masks the
//     whole replica.
//   - 1,490 um2 on sg13g2, +1.06 % (section 9 cost table).
//
// keep on `bits` is a third, weakest layer: measured on this design it
// does NOT stop the merge on its own (it preserves the wire name while
// the storage still disappears), so it is here only to stop opt_clean,
// never as evidence that the bank survived. The evidence is the
// flip-flop count in sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py, which now
// asserts the forced-flatten count as well as the intact one.
//
// The stored image is `enc(value) ^ POL` and the port presents
// `dec(bits ^ POL)`, so every user of q sees the true configuration
// value and only the physical cells differ. A debugger reading
// u_cfg_b.bits sees the complement of the configuration and
// u_cfg_c.bits sees its mixed image, both by design.
