// lif_core: time-multiplexed LIF neuron datapath (docs/10-npu-mvp-spec.md
// sections 1-4), pilot configuration with flip-flop synapse storage.
//
// One physical update pipeline serves N_NEURONS leaky integrate-and-fire
// neurons over an N_AXONS x N_NEURONS crossbar of 4-bit signed weights.
// The golden model sw/golden/lif_core.py is the normative executable
// specification; this module reproduces it bit for bit and is verified
// against it in lockstep by hw/tb/test_lif_core_rtl.py
// (make -f Makefile.lif in hw/tb). Lockstep constrains the arithmetic,
// not the control interface: the command-arbitration, handshake and
// SAFE-state behavior below is the part the golden model cannot express,
// and it is covered separately by the directed handshake tests in the
// same suite and by the proofs in formal/lif_ctrl_props.v
// (cd formal && make lif_all -- through formal/Makefile, NOT
// `make -f lif_ctrl.mk`, which this line used to say: the fragment
// falls back to `command -v sby` when it is not included by that
// makefile, and on the development machine that resolves to a sibling
// project's toolchain. Measured 2026-08-30, and it is the same
// incident tools.mk was written for).
//
// Pilot scope (docs/02 section 3, Candidate A storage class, reached by
// fallback trigger F1): the synapse array is a flip-flop file (default
// 32 x 32 x 4 b = 4 kb) written through a one-weight-per-cycle load port
// -- no SRAM macro. Since the memory-hardening section below the array
// carries its own SECDED code, so E10 (uncorrectable-word zero
// substitution) IS implemented in this configuration, at exactly the
// 16-weight word granularity the golden model's word_index() defines.
// Every numbered equation of spec section 4 is implemented here. Neuron
// state (V, R) is likewise a flip-flop file and is likewise coded.
// E9 (multi-pass neuron tiling) touches the datapath only
// through cfg_tile_off, added to emitted neuron ids per E5; pass
// sequencing is owned upstream (spec section 9).
//
// Equations implemented (docs/10 section 4, bit-exact):
//   E1  w = sext4(W[a][j])                       4-bit signed decode
//   E2  c = w << S_SYN                           exact, S_SYN in [0, 7],
//       so c in [-1024, +896]: an 11-bit signed intermediate is exact
//   E3  V' = sat16(V + c)                        full-width sum (18-bit
//       signed), then clamp to [-32768, +32767] -- never a two's
//       complement wrap (a wrapped positive overflow would lose a spike)
//   E4  spike iff V' >= THETA (signed compare)   checked AFTER the update,
//       on every non-gated event, including zero contributions
//   E5  on spike: V = V_RESET, R = T_REFR, emit id = TILE_OFF + j
//   E6  leak toward zero by max(|V| >> S_LEAK, 1); the sign never flips;
//       |V| is computed at 16-bit unsigned width (|-32768| = 16'h8000 =
//       32768 is representable); gated by cfg_leak_en, independent of R
//   E7  refractory: R > 0 gates E1..E5 for that (event, neuron) with no
//       state change; TICK decrements R toward zero
//   E8  one command is consumed at a time, neurons are scanned in
//       ascending j, spikes are emitted in scan order: the core is a
//       deterministic function of (state, configuration, weights, input
//       event order); TICK processing emits nothing
//
// Cycle schedule (one neuron per cycle, ascending j, no pipelining):
//
//   S_IDLE  1 cycle minimum between commands. A command is accepted on
//           the clock edge where its valid and ready are both high;
//           priority is state_clr > synaptic event > tick. Debug state
//           writes (dbg_wr_en) and weight loads land here by contract.
//   S_EV    N_NEURONS cycles for a synaptic event: on cycle j the core
//           reads V[j], R[j] and W[axon][j], applies E7 then E1..E5, and
//           writes V[j] / R[j] back on the same edge. A spike enters the
//           1-deep output holding register (out_valid / out_event); while
//           that register is occupied and out_ready is low the scan
//           stalls, adding one cycle per stalled cycle, so backpressure
//           reaches the pipeline and no spike is ever dropped (spec
//           section 7.2).
//   S_TICK  N_NEURONS cycles: on cycle j, E6 leak and E7 countdown for
//           neuron j. Never emits, never stalls (spec section 4.2).
//   S_CLR   N_NEURONS cycles: zero V and R (CTRL.STATE_CLR, spec 11.1).
//   S_SAFE  fault parking state (spec section 11.4). Entered only from an
//           illegal state encoding, i.e. from an upset; latches
//           STATUS.ERR_CFG on the err_cfg output, freezes the neuron
//           state file, accepts no further command, emits nothing new
//           (a spike already held still drains), and is left only by
//           reset (blk_rst_n, which CTRL.SOFT_RST asserts in the pilot).
//           The weight load port is unaffected, like everywhere else --
//           see the w_wr_en bullet of the Contract block.
//
//   Throughput at full output bandwidth: N_NEURONS + 1 cycles per
//   synaptic event or tick (32 + 1 at the pilot default). Latency of the
//   first spike of an event: 1 + (j + 1) cycles for the first spiking
//   neuron j. The scan cost is independent of the event's sparsity --
//   this is the time-multiplexing trade of docs/02 Candidate B, kept
//   here so the pilot datapath is the same datapath.
//
// Output interface is aer_fifo write-side compatible: out_valid -> wr_en,
// out_event -> wr_data, out_ready -> !full. out_event is the frozen
// 16-bit local event word of spec section 7.1:
// {TYPE = 2'b00 SPIKE, 4'b0000 reserved, ID[9:0] = TILE_OFF + j}.
// The holding register is overwritten on the same edge the FIFO samples
// it, so a spike can be emitted every cycle while out_ready holds.
//
// CFG_NEUR / CFG_AXON (spec section 6 and register map 0x20 / 0x24) have
// no port here. This is a deliberate design decision, not an omission,
// and it is restated here because hw/rtl/npu_regbank.v does implement a
// writable, range-validated CFG_NEUR register and exports it on a
// cfg_neur output: in any integration of the two, that output has no
// consumer in this module and the N_NEURONS parameter is authoritative
// for the active neuron count. hw/rtl/pilot_top.v resolves the same
// question the other way round for its own register file -- its
// deviation D2 makes CFG_NEUR read-only and reports N_NEURONS -- so the
// pilot never presents the host with a setting that does nothing. An SoC
// that instantiates npu_regbank in front of this core must do one of the
// two: either tie CFG_NEUR read-only to N_NEURONS as the pilot does, or
// accept that writes to it are ignored by the datapath.
//
// Why the parameter is authoritative: the golden model, which this
// datapath must match bit for bit, carries no runtime active-neuron
// count. n_neurons is fixed at construction, the scan always covers all
// of it, and NetworkRunner models a partial E9 tile as a narrower core
// rather than as a reduced CFG_NEUR. Implementing a runtime CFG_NEUR
// would therefore be RTL with no golden reference. It is not needed for
// E9 correctness in this build: an unused top neuron whose weight column
// is zero and whose state is cleared holds V = 0 forever (leak preserves
// zero), and THETA >= 1 by configuration validation, so it can never
// emit. Software runs a partial tile by zeroing the unused weight
// columns before the pass; test_e9_partial_tile_matches_a_narrower_core
// is the evidence. The cost is scan cycles, not correctness.
//
// Contract (register-block obligations, not re-checked here):
//   - configuration inputs hold golden-validated values (LIFConfig ranges,
//     spec section 6) and are stable while busy is high;
//   - every index port addresses an entry that exists: ev_axon < N_AXONS
//     (the CFG_AXON out-of-range drop and the CNT_AXON_OOR counter live
//     upstream, spec section 6), w_wr_axon < N_AXONS,
//     w_wr_neuron < N_NEURONS and dbg_addr < N_NEURONS. The index widths
//     round up to a power of two, so at a non-power-of-two geometry these
//     ports can encode indices with no array entry behind them, and such
//     an access reads or writes outside the flip-flop file;
//   - cfg_tile_off + N_NEURONS <= 1024 (frozen 10-bit event-word ID
//     field, spec section 9 limitation), so spike_id never wraps;
//   - weight-load writes (w_wr_en) and debug state writes (dbg_wr_en) are
//     issued only while busy is low. The two ports behave differently if
//     that obligation is broken, and the difference is structural:
//       * w_wr_en is NOT interlocked. It sits outside the state machine
//         and commits in any state, S_SAFE included. It cannot corrupt
//         the scan's write-back, because the scan never writes wmem, but
//         a weight write during S_EV to the index the scan is about to
//         read (w_rd_index) changes the value that event integrates --
//         a read-during-write race on one synapse, and the reason the
//         idle-only obligation exists.
//       * dbg_wr_en IS interlocked: the vmem/rmem write lives inside the
//         S_IDLE arm of the case, so it is structurally impossible for a
//         debug write to race the scan's own write-back. The failure
//         mode of a mid-scan debug write is therefore a silently dropped
//         write, not a corrupted neuron.
//   - state_clr is sampled only while the neuron scan is idle. A spike
//     still held in the output register does not block it: the clear runs
//     and the held spike drains normally. Pulses raised during S_EV /
//     S_TICK / S_CLR / S_SAFE are ignored, not queued.
//
// Spec deviation, input event ordering (docs/10 section 4.3 E8 rule 1):
// SPIKE and TICK arrive here on two independent valid/ready channels with
// a fixed SPIKE-over-TICK priority, so the interface cannot express the
// relative arrival order of the two event types. E8 rule 1 requires
// events to be consumed in FIFO arrival order; that ordering is real for
// SPIKEs among themselves (one channel, one command in flight), but a
// TICK that arrived before a SPIKE is overtaken by it if both are
// presented at once. Providing the mechanism in this module would mean a
// single merged command channel carrying the 2-bit TYPE field of spec
// section 7.1, which is a different port list and a change of the
// pilot integration, so it is recorded as a deviation instead.
// Consequence for the host: the source MUST serialize the two channels --
// present at most one of ev_valid / tick_valid at a time, and raise the
// next one only after the previous command has been accepted. Under that
// restriction the interface reproduces E8 rule 1 exactly.
// hw/rtl/pilot_top.v already satisfies it by construction: its dispatcher
// pops one word from a single input FIFO, decodes the TYPE field, and
// drives exactly one of the two valids from the D_ISSUE state, so
// arrival order in that FIFO is the consumption order. A future mesh link
// receiver has the same obligation.
//
// Neuron and weight state after hardware reset is UNDEFINED (spec section
// 3): the V/R/weight flip-flop files are deliberately not on the reset
// net; software issues state_clr and loads weights before enabling
// traffic. Only the control registers reset. The FSM uses a
// Hamming-distance-2 state encoding with default-case recovery to the
// S_SAFE parking state, which latches STATUS.ERR_CFG on the err_cfg
// output, exactly as spec section 11.4 requires; err_cfg is a level
// output for the register block's ERR_CFG sticky bit and is cleared only
// by reset. The three memory files carry their own codes; the check
// storage is not on the reset net either, for the same reason and with
// the same consequence -- it is defined by the first STATE_CLR and the
// first weight load, exactly like the data it covers.
//
// =====================================================================
// OUTPUT FLAG RAILS (added 2026-08-30, docs/16 section 5.11)
// =====================================================================
//
// out_pend -- the one-bit "the output holding register is occupied"
// flag -- was 3 of 3 silent corruptions in the fault-injection
// campaign, the worst per-bit rate left in the design after the memory
// hardening below. It is the third member of the class docs/16 section
// 5.7 named: in this design the dangerous small state is the VALID
// FLAGS, not the indices. An upset that sets it emits out_event again,
// which is a spike the network never produced; an upset that clears it
// drops a spike the network did produce, and stalls nothing because
// can_go frees immediately. Neither is visible to any consumer: the
// event word carries a TYPE and a 10-bit id and nothing that could
// distinguish a fabricated spike from a real one.
//
// It is two rails, not three replicas, and the reason is a proof:
// hw/rtl/pilot_top.v header section 8.2 carries it in full. One bit has
// exactly two storage functions, x and ~x, so polarity holds two
// replicas apart provably and a third has nothing left to take.
// lif_flag_rail at the end of this file is the rail; op_a / op_b are
// the two instances; a disagreement holds out_pend LOW (drop rather
// than fabricate), reports on pend_mismatch, and forces its own rewrite
// so the fault cannot persist. DETECTED, not corrected: the spike is
// still lost, but the host is told.
//
// Invisible in the fault-free case, which is the constraint that
// mattered here: hw/tb/test_lif_core_rtl.py's 32 lockstep tests against
// the frozen golden model sw/golden/lif_core.py pass unmodified, and so
// do the eight formal/lif_ctrl.sby tasks, including the H6 output
// handshake (out_valid never retracted without out_ready) which the
// rails could have broken had a disagreement been allowed to persist.
//
// =====================================================================
// MEMORY HARDENING (added after the docs/16 fault-injection campaign)
// =====================================================================
//
// What the campaign measured, at the 8 x 8 pilot geometry, per structure
// [fact, docs/16 sections 3 and 6]:
//
//   structure   FF    SDC rate   rate x FF ("expected silent corruptions")
//   wmem       256      56.2%      144   rank 1
//   vmem       128      91.7%      117   rank 2
//   rmem        32     100.0%       32   rank 3
//
// Those three were the whole residual risk: every structure the pilot
// already claimed to protect held 50 for 50. They are hardened here.
//
// -- 1. Choice per structure, and the arithmetic behind it -------------
//
// The choice is per structure because the cost of a code is set by the
// WORD it covers, not by the array it lives in, and the three arrays
// have very different natural word sizes.
//
//   wmem  SECDED (72,64) over 16 consecutive weights, one codeword per
//         word, reusing the proven hw/rtl/secded_enc.v + secded_dec.v.
//         8 check bits per 64 data bits = 12.5% overhead: +8 FF per 16
//         weights, +32 FF at 8 x 8. Corrects any single-bit upset in the
//         word, detects any double.
//
//   vmem  SECDED (26,20) over the 20-bit neuron state word {R[3:0],
//   rmem  V[15:0]} -- ONE codeword covering both files, not two.
//         6 check bits per neuron = +48 FF at 8 neurons. Corrects any
//         single-bit upset in V, in R or in the check field itself.
//
// The two decisions that are not obvious, stated with their numbers:
//
//   (a) Why 16 weights per codeword rather than per-weight parity.
//       Parity on a 4-bit weight costs 1 FF per 4 = 25% overhead
//       (+64 FF at 8 x 8) and only DETECTS. The (72,64) code costs
//       12.5% (+32 FF) and CORRECTS. The wide word is both cheaper and
//       stronger, and the 16-weight granularity is not a free choice
//       either: it is exactly WEIGHTS_PER_WORD in sw/golden/lif_core.py,
//       so word_index(axon, j) in the golden model names the same word
//       this hardware codes, and E10 becomes expressible against the
//       model rather than against a comment. The reason not to go wider
//       is the read mux, not the code: one codeword must be read whole
//       on every scan cycle.
//
//   (b) Why rmem is not TMR, which is what its 100% SDC rate invites.
//       TMR on rmem costs +64 FF (two extra copies of 32) and protects
//       32 bits: 2.0 added flip-flops per protected bit. Coding V and R
//       together costs 6 check bits per neuron and protects 160 bits:
//       0.3 added flip-flops per protected bit. And the 6 is not a
//       compromise -- a SECDED code over V ALONE (16 data bits) needs
//       5 Hamming checks plus an overall parity bit, which is also 6.
//       So rmem, the structure with the worst per-bit rate in the whole
//       design, is protected at ZERO marginal flip-flop cost by sharing
//       the codeword V had to pay for anyway. That is the cheapest large
//       win available and it is cheaper than the one the campaign's own
//       recommendation named.
//
// Options considered and rejected, with the reason:
//
//   TMR on all three (+832 FF, 72% of the whole design's register count)
//     -- rejected on area, and it buys nothing a SECDED word does not,
//     since the threat model here is one flipped bit.
//   Parity + invalidate on vmem (+8 FF) -- rejected because there is no
//     value to substitute. V IS the neuron's memory; "invalidate" means
//     losing it, so the policy converts an SDC into a detected loss
//     rather than into a correct answer, and the campaign already showed
//     that 24 of 34 state upsets corrupt only the RETAINED state, which
//     is precisely the case a correction fixes and an invalidation does
//     not.
//   Periodic scrubbing alone (hw/rtl/scrub.v) -- rejected as the primary
//     mechanism because scrubbing needs a code to scrub against; it is a
//     way of bounding the accumulation of errors a code can already
//     correct, not a substitute for the code. What this module does get
//     for free is described in section 3 below.
//   Host reload of the weight image (docs/16 section 5.4) -- kept as a
//     complementary policy, not as the mechanism. It bounds wmem
//     corruption by the reload interval and costs no silicon, but it
//     cannot touch vmem or rmem, which have no protected source to be
//     restored from.
//
// -- 2. Transparency ---------------------------------------------------
//
// In the absence of an injected fault this module is bit-for-bit and
// cycle-for-cycle what it was before the hardening, and that is a
// requirement rather than an observation: sw/golden/lif_core.py is the
// frozen specification and hw/tb/test_lif_core_rtl.py runs bit-exact
// lockstep against it. Both codes are systematic and combinational: a
// clean codeword decodes to its own data field with sec = ded = 0, so
// every value the datapath consumes is the value the unhardened module
// consumed, in the same cycle. No pipeline stage was added, no handshake
// changed, no state was added to the FSM. The only new ports are four
// LEVEL outputs (wmem_sec, wmem_ded, state_sec, state_ded); the
// instantiation in hw/rtl/pilot_top.v leaves them unconnected, which is
// legal and which is why this change needs no edit there.
//
// The one behaviour that is new in the fault-free case is a write that
// writes the same value it read (section 3). It changes no observable.
//
// -- 3. Write-back scrubbing, at zero flip-flop cost --------------------
//
// The neuron state file is now written on EVERY cycle the scan visits a
// neuron, including the two cases the unhardened module skipped: a
// refractory-gated neuron under E7, and a TICK on a neuron with R = 0
// and leak disabled. The value written in those cases is the value that
// was read -- after correction. In the fault-free case that is a write
// of the identical word and changes nothing, which is what keeps the
// lockstep exact. After an upset it is a repair: the corrected state and
// its recomputed check field replace the corrupted ones, so a single-bit
// error in vmem or rmem does not merely fail to propagate, it is gone by
// the next event or tick that touches that neuron. This is the scrub
// loop of docs/10 section 11.2 obtained from the existing scan instead
// of from a scrubber, and it costs no flip-flop and no cycle.
//
// wmem does NOT get this, and the difference is worth being exact
// about. The scan never writes wmem, so there is no visit to scrub on.
// The load port is a read-modify-write and it does re-encode the whole
// codeword, so a full weight-image reload -- the mitigation docs/16
// section 5.4 recommends and the only way the pilot's loader writes at
// all -- leaves every word exactly clean. A partial write of one weight
// does not repair the other fifteen; the reasoning, and why splicing
// into decoded data was tried and rejected, is at the load-port
// read-modify-write below.
//
// -- 4. What a double-bit error does -----------------------------------
//
//   wmem   E10, docs/10 section 11.2 and sw/golden/lif_core.py
//          poison_word(): every weight of an uncorrectable word
//          contributes zero for as long as the word stays uncorrectable,
//          and wmem_ded is raised while the scan reads it. Fail-
//          operational, and bit-exact against a golden core built with
//          that word poisoned.
//   vmem   the data field passes through uncorrected and state_ded is
//   rmem   raised. There is no fail-operational substitution for a
//          membrane potential -- any value this module could invent
//          would be a spec deviation with no golden reference -- so the
//          policy is report, not repair. The host's recovery is
//          CTRL.STATE_CLR.
//
// One consequence of the write-back scrub that is stated rather than
// discovered later: an uncorrectable neuron state word is announced on
// the cycle it is read, and the same cycle's write-back re-encodes the
// word around the data it could not repair. So a double error is
// reported ONCE, when it is read, and is part of the neuron's state
// afterwards rather than being reported on every following scan. The
// alternative -- freezing the neuron so the flag keeps firing -- would
// make a two-bit upset stop the datapath, which is a worse failure for a
// fail-operational part than a wrong V. Whichever way, the record is a
// telemetry event and it is the register block's job to keep it.
//
// -- 5. Surviving synthesis --------------------------------------------
//
// This design has already been bitten once by redundancy that synthesis
// could prove equivalent and therefore merged away (hw/rtl/pilot_top.v
// header section 9: three configuration TMR replicas became one bank).
// The structures added here are not replicas -- a check field is not
// equal to anything, so opt_merge has nothing to hash it against -- but
// "not a replica" is an argument, and an argument is not evidence.
// The evidence is sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py, which counts
// flip-flop CELLS per structure in the MAPPED netlist of both flows and
// fails if smem, wchk, wmem, vmem or rmem is short of its declared
// width. The specific hazard it is aimed at is stated there: the check
// field is a pure function of the data field in every reachable state,
// so a tool that could reason across sequential state could replace the
// storage with the encoder and leave a decoder that always reports a
// clean word. Nothing in yosys does that today. The test is what says
// so tomorrow.
//
// The check storage is declared as a FLAT packed vector rather than as
// an array, for two reasons that are both about being checkable: yosys
// gives a flat vector a single netname so the guard test can count it
// exactly, and the constant-index generate that assembles the weight
// codewords keeps the 16 nibble reads of one word from becoming 16
// independent address decoders over the whole array.
//
// -- 6. Cost, measured -------------------------------------------------
//
// Flip-flops, counted in the MAPPED sg13g2 netlist of the whole pilot
// (tt_um_melihakbulut_nssoc at 8 x 8, yosys 0.67+146, the pinned
// checkout of tools.mk) [fact]:
//
//   structure          before   after   added
//   wmem  data            256     256       0
//   wchk  check             0      32     +32
//   vmem  data            128     128       0
//   rmem  data             32      32       0
//   smem  check             0      48     +48
//   whole pilot          1155    1235     +80
//
// So 416 of the pilot's flip-flops -- 34% of the design, and all three
// of the campaign's top-ranked structures -- move from unprotected to
// single-error-correcting for 80 added flip-flops, 6.9% of the register
// count.
//
// Cell area, same netlist, `stat -liberty sg13g2_stdcell_typ_1p20V_25C`

    //   a rail's next value may be a plain expression only if every

    //   flop while `d = a || b` with a unknown latches X forever.
    //
    // This flag is the case that is not X-free. out_emit reads the
    // neuron state file through spike and r_cur, and vmem / rmem are
    // deliberately NOT on the reset net (see the header): they are
    // defined by the first STATE_CLR, so before it out_emit is X. The

    // output queue never drains. Measured: that form fails
    // test_axon_out_of_range_is_dropped_and_counted in

    // repository, including the whole fault-injection campaign [fact,
    // 2026-08-30].

    // A fill (out_emit) beats a drain (wr_accept), which is the
    // priority the sequential block expressed by assigning out_pend
    // twice in one edge.
    //
    // What this shape gives up, stated rather than glossed: the rails
    // do NOT self-heal. A disagreement persists until the next emit or
    // accept rewrites both, so on a core that then goes idle
    // pend_mismatch stays high and STATUS.ERR_CFG cannot be cleared
    // until the core emits again or CTRL.SOFT_RST is used -- the same
    // recovery, and the same shape of behaviour, as the parked-core
    // live term the pilot already documents. The alternative,
    // `en = out_emit || wr_accept || op_mm`, does self-heal and is
    // X-safe, and it was measured and rejected: it puts the rails' own
    // disagreement inside their enable, and formal/lif_ctrl.sby's bmc
    // task then reached step 20 in 33 minutes against 3 minutes for the
    // mux form and 16 minutes for the whole 40-step run on the pre-rail
    // design [fact, same machine, same engine]. A four-fold slowdown of
    // a proof gate is too much to pay for healing a fault the host has
    // already been told about.
    //
    // The k-induction does not need the healing either, which is the
    // measurement that made this choice safe rather than merely cheap:

// module cannot instantiate pilot_flag_rail in any case, since
// pilot_top.v is its own parent. The alternative, a fourth RTL file
// every flow has to be told about, buys nothing that six lines of
// duplication cost.
//
// Both defences of pilot_cfg_bank, and neither trusted alone:
// keep_hierarchy stops `flatten` and opt_merge, and POL gives the two
// rails different stored functions -- a $_DFFE_PN0P_ and a
// $_DFFE_PN1P_ for as long as the design is RTLIL -- so that structural
// hashing has nothing to match once the attribute is gone. At one bit
// polarity is not merely sufficient for two rails, it is complete: x
// and ~x are the only two storage functions there are, which is also
// why this is two rails and not three (hw/rtl/pilot_top.v header
// section 8.2).
//
// POL is measured rather than argued. With EVERY `keep` and
// `keep_hierarchy` deleted from hw/rtl, both the ASIC and the ECP5
// recipes keep all 1296 flip-flops; mutating one rail's `.POL(1'b1)` to
// `.POL(1'b0)` takes both to 1295. Measured 2026-08-31 [fact];
// sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py section 1e.
//
// POL does not reach silicon. pilot_flag_rail's header in
// hw/rtl/pilot_top.v carries the full account: the stored reset value
// is `1'b0 ^ POL`, sg13g2 offers dfflibmap no asynchronous flip-flop
// that resets to 1, so dfflibmap builds one by inverting D and Q around
// sg13g2_dfrbpq and those inverters fold against this module's own
// `d ^ POL` and `bits ^ POL`. The enable does not save it -- the mux
// absorbs the D-side inverter and comes back out the same gate.
// Measured in hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/signoff-6x2/final/nl/ [fact]:
// u_op_a is 1 x sg13g2_mux2_1 + 1 x sg13g2_dfrbpq_1 and u_op_b is
// 1 x sg13g2_mux2_1 + 1 x sg13g2_buf_1 + 1 x sg13g2_dfrbpq_1, no
// inverter in either and both storing out_pend in true polarity. It is
// safe, because dfflibmap runs after the last merge pass this flow
// performs, but the two flip-flops in the shipped netlist are not the
// evidence that POL worked -- the attribute-stripped synthesis is.
// docs/33-rail-transform.md.
//
// The port presents `bits ^ POL`, so both rails read true and the
// consumer compares them for EQUALITY. A debugger reading u_op_b.bits
// in an RTL simulation sees the complement of out_pend, by design; in

//
// This copy takes an ENABLE, and the other two do not. The rule and the

// The code. Extended Hamming: five Hamming check bits over the 20 data
// bits, plus one overall-parity bit, giving minimum distance 4 --
// single-error correcting and double-error detecting. The (72,64) Hsiao
// code of secded_enc.v is not used here because at 20 data bits the
// Hsiao construction saves nothing: both need six check bits, and the
// extended-Hamming syndrome is a position index, which is smaller to
// decode than 26 column comparisons.
//
// Construction, normative and shared by both modules below. Number the
// code positions 1..25 in the classical Hamming order. The five check
// positions are the powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16); the remaining 20 are
// the data positions, in ascending order, and they are exactly 20 --
// which is why 20 is the natural data width for a 5-bit Hamming
// syndrome:
//
//   data bit j  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

//
// H_MASK[i] below is the 20-bit mask of the data bits whose position has
// bit i set, i.e. the i-th Hamming parity group. The masks are derived
// from that table and nothing else; sw/tests and formal/lif_mem.sby both
// re-derive the same code independently and would fail on a typo.

// what makes the hardening invisible to the golden-model lockstep.
