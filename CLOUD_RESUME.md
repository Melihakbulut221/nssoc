# Current cloud-only continuation — 2026-10-18

All work is CLOUD ONLY under the latest user instruction. Local task workspace is empty. Do not clone, download native archives/waves, write source locally, run local CAD/tests or start a self-hosted runner. Use GitHub Git Data API for source edits and GitHub-hosted Actions for execution. Preserve healthy jobs and all original failure evidence. Do not mark the active goal complete: full serial Gen3x4 PHY, integrated mainchip routing and final setup/hold are still OPEN.

## Full physical PD420 remains electrically rejected

The actual PD420 physical/model chain passed: parent39116999945(560DRC/deep-flat420LVS), planes39117334854, wireinputs39117796759, binding39118454522, freshRC39118996010, MIMcapture39119282623, rawaudit39119562797, composition39119795848.

Read-only39121253725 confirms retimed input attenuation and actual large wire capacitance; receipt cdr-hybrid-v2-native-path-review-20261018.json. Standalone sampler success will NOT supersede this full-parent rejection.

## Current native sampler repair

Design rationale and all intermediate outcomes: docs/pcie-cdr-sampler-load-drive-design-20261018.md.

1. Invalid load-drivev2 run39122483815 failed native startup. Exact archived model review39123356324 confirms npn13G2 Nx1..10; Nx16 clock devices were invalid and made Csub negative. Original failure and aborted175row trajectory retained. Receipt cdr-sampler-load-drive-model-domain-rejection-20261018.json. Native model SHAae9288f885dd30fab24b07ed1e7e02e69eac9154022a0a6da576985183b0bd79. Decode archived model text Latin1, never change its bytes.
2. Split-drivev3 run39123587911 replaces each invalidNx16 with two actual separateNx8 devices:16HBT(allNx8,total128),3MOS,12rppd. Native startup fixed; all three corners768samples pass at1pF/output, zero diagnostics. Device VCE limits stillfailed. Both actual faults detected. Receipt cdr-sampler-split-drive-data-pass-device-rejection-20261018.json. Native domain controls reject sourceNx0/11/16 before simulator.
3. Headroomv4 run39123948513 changes only inputAVDDpullups length3.6→2.4um. Nominal/cold and both faults now pass all retained gates; hot_low data passes(min110.576mV,max35.469ps) but four slave HBT minima0.38608/0.38658/0.36935/0.36971V fail0.4V. Receipt cdr-sampler-headroom-hot-device-rejection-20261018.json.
4. Read-only native review39124255052 at725542c6105962c4e5f4d9b4360544720934d9db reproduces all four hot extrema and nearby original terminal/current samples. Receipt cdr-sampler-headroom-native-extrema-20261018.json. Worsthold is low-current interval just after clock edge: emitter1.780662V, collector2.150008V, VBE0.594174V,IC88.676uA. No relaxation for inactive HBTs.
5. This commit launches cdr-sampler-bleed-cloud.yml for v5. Only slave SE/HE rppd bleeder lengths38.4→9.6um, width1um; master unchanged through explicit separate native slave subcircuit. Source hw/soc/analog/pcie/rx_sampler_bleed_v5.spice and controller scripts/cloud_cdr_sampler_bleed.py. All original5cases/256bits/34.25ns/0.3125ps/1pF/100mV/37.5ps/transistor/startup/domain/source gates unchanged. Inspect actual results before physical integration. No acceptance yet.

## Mandatory next work

Inspect v5 exact run/terminal evidence, preserve any rejection and fix actual circuit before adoption. If all component gates pass, build actual new sampler geometry with separate clock devices and a real folded/parallel128um tail implementation. Old generator assumes cell height<70um and one local tap perMOS; do not blindly reuse it for128um devices or claim its old38device LVS. Require native560DRC, unsimplified deep/flatLVS, actual fault controls, LEF and fresh parasitic extraction, then regenerate full parent and replay the ORIGINAL loaded early/late, faults, PVT/constants and closed-loop gates. No standalone1pF screen replaces actual distributed wire/model validation.

Full PLL/CDR acquisition, SERDES/PCS/LTSSM/replay integration, all four serial lanes, analog pads/ESD and full-chip links remain required. Existing original audit scope and manufacturing/RCminmax/SRAM/LVS requirements remain open unless individually proven. Healthy remote jobs survive local shutdown; checkpoints and evidence live in GitHub. Read the historical continuation document for prior attempts, not stale live-status paragraphs.

## Latest actual v5 result and v6 run to inspect

V5 cdr-sampler-bleed39124621809 at2dc72303010a7aa87641693fca162f5f5c21e01d completed. Nominal/hot and faults pass; cold onlyslaveDPVBE1.000106822V>1V fails. Every normal data test passes. Exactreceipt cdr-sampler-bleed-cold-vbe-rejection-20261018.json. V6 cdr-sampler-balanced-cloud launches from this commit: ONLYslaveDATA emitter bleederL9.6→12.8um, HOLDstays9.6um, allboundaries/gates/native models unchanged. Inspect its real outcome next. Physicalwork remains mandatory after electricalscreen; do not adopt v5 or claimfullPHY/timeclosure.

## Latest authoritative v6 milestone — supersedes pending v6 status

V6 native balanced sampler39125008269 at13e670e3b356924603e18e7cc4fd4e16d0ae4d7b is terminalSUCCESS with actual allfive reports verified, not merely green workflow. All3normalconditions768correctsamples/1pF/100mV/37.5ps and all16HBT/3MOSdevicegates pass. Both actualfaultsdetected and devicesafe under retainedscreen. No diagnostics,16nativeOFFreadbacks, zeroOP, sourceimmutability, sourceNx0/11/16mutationrejections pass. Receipt docs/evidence/cdr-sampler-balanced-native-pass-20261018.json contains all5full reports and archive pins. Candidate source hw/soc/analog/pcie/rx_sampler_balanced_v6.spice, controller scripts/cloud_cdr_sampler_balanced.py.

NEXT ACTUAL WORK: physical implementation of this repaired sampler, including viable128um tail realization and actual body contacts. Existing generator needs geometry changes; possible separate4x32um NMOS or foldednativePCell changes require their own electrical revalidation before use. Exact v6 topology16HBT/3MOS/12rppd, allHBTNx8(total128), reference8um/tails128um,L.3um, collectorW32L2.12, inputpullupsW1L2.4; onlyslavebleedsDATAW1L12.8/HOLDW1L9.6; masterbleedsW1L38.4. Use actualgeometry560DRC/deepflatLVS/faults/LEF/freshRC, rebuild parent with new IDs/RC, and replay originalwholeloaded andlooptests. Do not substitute thisscreen for fullPD420 previouslyfailed loadedwaves. Native model is nominalHBT with three temperature/supplyconditions, not completeprocessqualification.

## New physical-tail candidate v7 to inspect

This commit launches cdr-sampler-parallel-cloud.yml: each128um tail becomes four actual32um/L.3/ng1 native NMOS with identical D/G/S/B, retaining totalwidth128um perstage and reference8um. Counts16HBT/9MOS/12rppd; all HBT/resistor/reference maps exactly compared against passedv6. No electrical equivalence assumption. Original stagecurrentgate uses actual sum of four native currents and all individualMOSvoltagechecks remain. Allfiveoriginal1pF/fullwindow/data/device/fault/source/modeldomain gates rerun. Candidate rx_sampler_parallel_v7.spice and cloud_cdr_sampler_parallel.py. After actualpass, implementreal54devicegeometry incl17taps with fullnativeDRC/LVS/LEF/faults and newparentRC; oldgeometrynotvalid. Mainchip39121691046 and TX39112087217 verifiedin_progress before this change, preserve.
