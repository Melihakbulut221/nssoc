# Latest correction — resistor merge switches verified; full macro running

Native controls **43553545114 passed all 16 cases**. Original Ruby RES2 merges serial and parallel pairs even with both requested switches off; the two-line correction honors all four switch combinations. Controls instantiate the actual Ruby class in native resistor graphs with boundary pins; no unsupported getter or Python imitation. Original harness failures 43553195656/43553342992 are terminal and superseded.

Full frozen DP SRAM candidate **43553707234**, source `c077726eb378897ef2bf2b2e10bb8c6333195111`, branch `codex/sram-strict-resistor-merge-fix`, is **in_progress** at this observation. It pins successful control artifact14096828657 SHA256 `b58b9142d77cb2f5b429ea23df5854b5e65f5bb19158561d635f9be9872214da`, verifies the original custom_devices source, and adds only the tested two-line switch correction. Existing strict W/L, ports and extraction checks remain unchanged. The new expected 70110 recursive-device guard is derived from 62046+8064 formerly merged pairs and must be verified by the run; it is not yet a measured macro result. Other vendor width/model/hierarchy issues remain open.

Result and provenance: `docs/evidence/sram-resistor-merge-switch-controls-20261114.json`. Reproducible control source is now `scripts/check_sram_resistor_merge_switches.py` on integration. Experimental workflow remains on its own branch. No native files or local checkout created.

Continue the six older live runs: fresh CRC physical43550440744, five-driver hold/antenna43541234973, five-driver antenna43538031308, original DP flat43529228292, alternative SRAM RC43534692191, MBIST/boot43516903518. Four-driver43528773096 is terminal/rejected, not live. Poll before acting.

# Latest terminal result — four-driver antenna candidate rejected

Run **43528773096** completed/failure: **DRC=0, antenna nets/pins=1/1**, slow setup **1367** (WNS -2.070215 ns, TNS -478.996881 ns), slow hold3, typical hold11, fast hold**82** (WNS -0.319650 ns). Electrical/fanout gates also fail. Evidence `docs/evidence/cut10j-four-driver-antenna-result-20261114.json`. Do not adopt this candidate or call it timing closure.

SRAM isolated Ruby control run **43553195656** failed before testing flags; captured subprocess stderr had been hidden by the harness. Diagnostic retry **43553342992**, source `1b412c55021425ec17be2601548e81bcb5c1f1d7`, branch `codex/sram-resistor-merge-switch-controls`, preserves native stdout/stderr in a derived JSON and was live at the latest check. Diagnose that failure before applying the proposed merge-switch correction. No pass yet.

# Latest investigation — original resistor geometry and ignored merge switches

Observed 2026-11-14T03:45:29.353822+00:00. Cloud geometry check **43552896584** independently confirms metal2/metal3 width differences in the frozen original SRAM GDS. Metal3 polygon count/dimensions match extraction; metal2 polygon count does not (16400 versus 8336 normalized devices), while width-binned total lengths agree. Failed direct-count test **43552738032** is preserved; aggregate agreement is not connectivity proof.

The exact frozen `RES2` class does **not** bind `supports_serial_combination`/`supports_parallel_combination` to requested switches. Thus prior `no_series_res=true` should not be interpreted as proof of no merge during `combine_devices`. Upstream PR1121 (still open, head `3df647ebe53439ae41d56a1e9c2b38003ba2124d`) contains a two-line fix and requires explicit metal-layer identity for LVSRES.

Isolated cloud controls **43553195656**, source `63876fda9e588ae2a7261f1ce85ee89b189c16ca`, branch `codex/sram-resistor-merge-switch-controls`, observed **completed**. These execute the original/fixed Ruby class for all four switch combinations, then native two-resistor serial/parallel controls (16 cases). If passed, integrate only the tested switch correction into an experimental macro flow, recompute unmerged primitive counts, and retain strict dimension/topology/port checks. The frozen GDS/CDL discrepancy remains separate. No class collapse, dimension waiver or physical acceptance.

Evidence: `docs/evidence/sram-original-geometry-and-merge-switches-20261114.json`. Existing native job statuses are pinned there; all seven other runs were re-polled in this continuation. Native files remain cloud-only.

# Latest result — hierarchy-expanded SRAM inventory

Cloud diagnostic [43552140757](https://github.com/Melihakbulut221/nssoc/actions/runs/43552140757) completed successfully at source `39512ef05cd88123d0e1d46554ce8067f3dd4414`. This supersedes the pending diagnostic below; it is **not** LVS acceptance.

Both full hierarchies contain **62,046** primitive devices. All MOS class/L/W/count distributions match exactly at 12-digit rounding. Inventory differences are restricted to metal resistor classes and widths: extracted metal2/metal3 include W=0.20/0.24 um while reference LVSRES uses W=0.26 um. Equal MOS inventory does not establish topology or supply connectivity. No GDS/CDL dimensions, tolerances, net aliases or acceptance gates were changed.

Evidence: `docs/evidence/sram-hierarchy-dimension-inventory-20261114.json` (artifact 14095939669, SHA256 `3a8436cfdfb54c22567d523850ff21a0574f8fd4e6225c64ed7a15bcedc147c4`). Next isolate model-reader identity and actual marker/reference mismatch before any source correction; require strict full LVS, negative controls and DRC for a candidate. Continue monitoring the exact active physical/MBIST/flat-LVS/RC handles below. No native data was downloaded to disk.

# Latest continuation — SRAM dimension diagnosis and rejected CDR screens

Observed 2026-11-14T03:32:49.878654+00:00. This section supersedes older live-status claims below.

- Current DP SRAM selective flatten run **43543201489 failed**: 25 Match, one top NoMatch; no Skipped, no extraction diagnostics. Hierarchy changes did not close LVS.
- Bounded top diagnosis **43551681909 succeeded** as a diagnostic, not LVS acceptance. Paired resistor samples show metal3 width **0.24 um versus reference 0.26 um**. Direct top inventories have different child boundaries and are not evidence of missing transistors. See `docs/evidence/sram-top-dimension-diagnosis-20261114.json`.
- Cloud hierarchy-expanded inventory diagnostic **43552140757**, source `39512ef05cd88123d0e1d46554ce8067f3dd4414`, branch `codex/sram-selective-flatten-top-diagnosis`, is completed at this observation. It reads the exact pinned selective-flatten database; no new extraction, net aliases, tolerance relaxation, or device omission. Inspect the resulting derived JSON before choosing a correction.
- CDR XOR nx=2 and nx=3 run **43542889935 failed electrical acceptance**. Both native simulations exited zero, device limits and phase passed, but X comparison has 386/392 wrong-sign samples and sampler A/C/D margins fail. No layout accepted. See `docs/evidence/cdr-xor-load-reduction-result-20261114.json`. Next diagnose data-path polarity/settling and sampler margins rather than repeat this load sweep.
- Fresh CRC physical **43550440744**, old-layout route candidates **43541234973 / 43538031308 / 43528773096**, DP flat LVS **43529228292**, alternative SRAM RC **43534692191**, full MBIST/boot **43516903518** were still in progress on this continuation. Poll exact handles; do not restart live jobs. Fresh CRC run remains probe-only and needs its own downstream detailed route/RC/STA after successful handoff.

All native artifacts remain in cloud. Full PHY, final timing, full current SRAM/chip LVS and manufacturing acceptance remain open.

# Latest continuation update — CRC proof and fresh physical candidate

This update supersedes the PCIe proof/live-run entries below. Other native jobs must still be re-polled by their exact handles. The full manufacturing-ready objective remains open; all native work stays in cloud.

- **CRC proof passed:** [43549353231](https://github.com/Melihakbulut221/nssoc/actions/runs/43549353231), source `0e86c8c8ec9db5838ae371821e6c047a6825d554`. Capacity 8: 551/551 points; capacity 32: 1351/1351, both directions. Proof-only semantic wire `fold_ordered_word=transmit_order(fold_word,fold_msb_first)` in the baseline provided 32 additional obligations, all proven. No assumed relation or output mask. Scope is Yosys async2sync/undef induction plus previously completed packet/reset simulations, not whole-chip or physical signoff. See `docs/evidence/pcie-crc-order-state-relation-result-20261114.json`.
- **Fault controls passed:** [43549920774](https://github.com/Melihakbulut221/nssoc/actions/runs/43549920774), source `81f6fec51e315d0bfa2b3188576715716dc9e857`. CRC bit and output bit corruption rejected in both directions (capacity 8); rc=1 and final unproven-equivalence assertion, no timeout acceptance. See `docs/evidence/pcie-crc-state-relation-negative-result-20261114.json`.
- **Fresh physical run LIVE:** [43550440744](https://github.com/Melihakbulut221/nssoc/actions/runs/43550440744), source `ecbcf43200413fc63844bbd20a7532f87af54216`, branch `codex/crc-order-fresh-physical`, job `132311448151`. Last observed CAD runtime setup. Uses exactly candidate RTL SHA256 `51aff3ebbbf80d251b4a3ebaa3c8da744d1c0e67fb3189f2cb947af1d15219ce`, all original cut10j knobs, fresh RTL simulation and synthesis through placement/CTS/global route and setup/hold repair. Emits a native `route-handoff-r_cut10j_td_d68-43550440744` artifact if successful. **This workflow contains only the probe job.** After completion, bind its exact handoff artifact/hash and run antenna-aware detailed routing, fresh RC extraction and all-corner STA. Never reuse old cut10j layout as evidence for new RTL. Existing fixed instance-name ECOs are from the old netlist and must not be blindly applied to this new synthesis.
- Candidate RTL remains **unmerged** in `timing/combined`; require fresh physical evaluation before adoption. Original failed proof runs 43543271489 (structural) and 43546370331 (deeper bitwise) are terminal timeouts, no longer live; their reports remain preserved.
- Initial physical dispatch at source `870322cd742c2ff872f39905eeaa5fb014aa30ac` was rejected HTTP422 because a header split matched the `pcie_jobs` input. No CAD job started. Corrected top-level split produced the live source above.

Still-live native handles at this update: SRAM selective flatten 43543201489; CDR actual-multiplicity XOR load screens 43542889935; old-layout hold/antenna candidate 43541234973; five-driver antenna 43538031308; four-driver antenna 43528773096; current DP flat LVS 43529228292 (deep child already failed); archived alternative SRAM RC 43534692191; native full MBIST/boot 43516903518. Re-poll before acting. No result here closes full PHY, current-chip LVS, final timing, qualified RC/Liberty, integrated pad/DFT, or production review.

## Latest findings and next decisions

- **SRAM:** run 43541320172 passed the scoped metal1 model/width/length/A-Z-open controls, then failed the full current DP macro: 25 Match, 6 NoMatch, 1 Skipped; both sides 62,046 primitive devices. The isolated leaf still lacks physical VDD/VSS ports and is not full-LVS accepted. The next hierarchy test preserves all primitives and the strict final port/extraction audit. See [controlled result](docs/evidence/sram-metal1-controlled-macro-result-20261114.json) and [open-control diagnosis](docs/evidence/sram-metal1-open-control-diagnosis-20261114.json). Do not waive dimensions, supply opens, unmatched ports or extraction warnings to obtain a pass. The older full flat job is still a separate pending comparison.
- **Ethernet hold:** full reports from rejected four-driver run 43505737740 show RX bank6 `A_ADDR[6]` setup +5.231030 ns in slow corner and hold -0.427385 ns in fast corner. The new candidate inserts three noninverting delay cells only on that endpoint branch, with Liberty identity, power and contracted-connectivity checks, then fresh routing/RC/STA. The source name had to be resolved from escaped ODB hierarchy; prior parser/name failures are preserved. These old path margins do not predict acceptance of the new layout. See [budget](docs/evidence/ethernet-rx-hold-budget-investigation-20261114.json) and [candidate](docs/evidence/cut10j-rx6-hold3-antenna-launch-20261114.json).
- **PCIe CRC RTL:** candidate byte-order retiming remains **unmerged**. Packet simulations and mutation tests passed, but both full mutual proof attempts timed out at 1,800 s. The cleaned proof left 402/1,178 unproven cells at capacities 8/32 before induction; no completed counterexample or proof. The new structural method still requires every remaining equivalence cell proven. See [proof record](docs/evidence/pcie-crc-order-cleaned-proof-timeout-20261114.json). Require successful mutual proof, negative controls and fresh physical timing before accepting the RTL candidate.
- **CDR:** sampled diagnostics found late/weak A/C-buffer transitions and six `nx=4` XOR base loads on each `nx=2` buffer collector. Two circuit-screen variants reduce only 24 XOR device `nx` parameters. Initial run 43542698325 was cancelled because the legacy checker used original emitter multiplicity for current density. Replacement 43542889935 uses the actual candidate binding and unchanged 3 mA/emitter limit. Existing interconnect RC is retained only for screening; a good waveform would still require new layout/extraction, numerical agreement and full operating-condition checks. See [response](docs/evidence/cdr-lowz8-buffer-response-20261114.json) and [corrected screen](docs/evidence/cdr-lowz8-xor-load-reduction-launch-20261114.json).
- **RC:** the swap-extended extraction is for an **archived alternative** DP8TSRAMDP256x16, not either vendor SRAM in the current chip. Apply independent topology/RC audit if it completes; never transfer its result to the current macro or claim qualified min/max RC.
- **Native MBIST:** the current full run includes system and Ethernet memories plus firmware handover; PCIe is idle and there is no SDF. Do not call it serial PHY or routed-timing proof.

## Completion remains unproven

Keep the full scope in [product acceptance](docs/92-product-acceptance.md), [second audit](docs/96-second-audit-closure.md) and the README. Outstanding work includes final setup/hold/electrical closure on the same routed chip, full current SRAM and chip LVS, qualified SRAM characterization/Liberty and min/max RC, full serial Gen3 x4 PHY/control/clock integration, integrated padframe/DFT and physical verification, manufacturing review, and the required silicon/radiation qualification. Historical pilot/core passes and scoped diagnostics do not close these requirements.

The previous checkpoint is retained below as history; its live-run statements and dates are not current.

# Claude handoff — terminal status update, 2026-11-04

Read [CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md](CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md) first for the detailed Turkish handover, exact sources, failures, measurements and next steps. Machine-readable selected evidence: [CLAUDE_HANDOFF_EVIDENCE.json](CLAUDE_HANDOFF_EVIDENCE.json).

At 2026-11-04 02:07 UTC, runs 41699812301, 41733225660, 41734419971 and corrected handoff 41739641054 were all completed/failure. No queued/in-progress runs were returned by the API. The old v360 live-status text below is historical.

- Route: supervisor memory-sample bounded-window failure; last successful RSS below limit. Route did not finish.
- Actual650 N1/N2: native transients exited zero; data/device/phase electrical gates failed.
- Handoff: original1691 scope correction passed its former failure point; DEF single-wire-clause parser now fails in prepare. Logical diode supplies passed; physical continuity unverified.
- Full serial PHY, completed mainchip routing, final timing and production acceptance remain open.

Documentation handoff only, not a new native experiment or v361 monitor rebuild. Native assets remain cloud-only. No CAD/simulation job dispatched for this handoff.

# Cloud continuation — checkpoint v360

Updated: 2026-11-03T23:21:08.981491+00:00

## Native route-class restoration and diode-inclusive netlist handoff

New source50f1ebf8d1c940abff985f971aeae670eeb4a9ec on codex/mainchip-postroute-handoff implements actual original full-chip class restoration, diode logical-supply audit, physical netlist export, fresh-library read/link and complete instance/pin/boundary incidence comparison. The old zero-diode route12 adapter and original timing gates remain unchanged. Source controls41738123187 passed, including six rejection cases; their1190-byte artifact13280920159 was authenticated in RAM.

Native job41738314531/release433325391 is the first real execution. Its initial input is the existing completed route41440285882, which still has known physical violations. It is a qualification of the handoff implementation, not the new full64 result and not signoff. It invokes no new routing. The complete real netlist comparison must pass, then native diode/port mutations must be rejected. Native failure must be diagnosed without silently omitting diodes/physical cells.

Current full64 route41699812301 and actual650 N1/N2 runs41733225660/41734419971 retain their exact handles. If the handoff implementation passes, acquire the completed full64 output with exact source/asset/member pins and apply it there before fresh RC/original-clock timing. Do not use the old zero-diode netlist. Original global class restoration and actual physical diode PG connectivity are distinct; the new logical supply check does not establish metal continuity or LVS.

The restored PLL terminal map and distinction between failed RHI120 and olderPLL845 captures remain documented in docs/pcie-cdr-pll-connection-audit-20261104.md. Current650 benches still use an external clock and do not prove a recovered-clock loop.
