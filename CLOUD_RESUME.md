# Cloud continuation — 2026-11-14

Observed at **2026-11-14T01:58:10.696260+00:00** on integration branch **`timing/combined`**.
Repository: https://github.com/Melihakbulut221/nssoc
This is a resume checkpoint, not a chip signoff. The manufacturing-ready goal remains open.
All source edits and native computations are in GitHub. Do not recreate a local CAD checkout or download native geometry, SPICE, netlists or waveforms. Read source and vetted derived summaries through API in RAM; filter mixed artifacts in cloud first.

Poll exact handles again before acting; these observations will age. Do not restart a live run on observation timeout. Inspect failed steps and derived reports before retrying. No pending result in this table is a pass.

## Latest findings and next decisions

- **SRAM:** run 43541320172 passed the scoped metal1 model/width/length/A-Z-open controls, then failed the full current DP macro: 25 Match, 6 NoMatch, 1 Skipped; both sides 62,046 primitive devices. The isolated leaf still lacks physical VDD/VSS ports and is not full-LVS accepted. The next hierarchy test preserves all primitives and the strict final port/extraction audit. See [controlled result](docs/evidence/sram-metal1-controlled-macro-result-20261114.json) and [open-control diagnosis](docs/evidence/sram-metal1-open-control-diagnosis-20261114.json). Do not waive dimensions, supply opens, unmatched ports or extraction warnings to obtain a pass. The older full flat job is still a separate pending comparison.
- **Ethernet hold:** full reports from rejected four-driver run 43505737740 show RX bank6 `A_ADDR[6]` setup +5.231030 ns in slow corner and hold -0.427385 ns in fast corner. The new candidate inserts three noninverting delay cells only on that endpoint branch, with Liberty identity, power and contracted-connectivity checks, then fresh routing/RC/STA. The source name had to be resolved from escaped ODB hierarchy; prior parser/name failures are preserved. These old path margins do not predict acceptance of the new layout. See [budget](docs/evidence/ethernet-rx-hold-budget-investigation-20261114.json) and [candidate](docs/evidence/cut10j-rx6-hold3-antenna-launch-20261114.json).
- **PCIe CRC RTL:** candidate byte-order retiming remains **unmerged**. Packet simulations and mutation tests passed, but both full mutual proof attempts timed out at 1,800 s. The cleaned proof left 402/1,178 unproven cells at capacities 8/32 before induction; no completed counterexample or proof. The new structural method still requires every remaining equivalence cell proven. See [proof record](docs/evidence/pcie-crc-order-cleaned-proof-timeout-20261114.json). Require successful mutual proof, negative controls and fresh physical timing before accepting the RTL candidate.
- **CDR:** sampled diagnostics found late/weak A/C-buffer transitions and six `nx=4` XOR base loads on each `nx=2` buffer collector. Two circuit-screen variants reduce only 24 XOR device `nx` parameters. Initial run 43542698325 was cancelled because the legacy checker used original emitter multiplicity for current density. Replacement 43542889935 uses the actual candidate binding and unchanged 3 mA/emitter limit. Existing interconnect RC is retained only for screening; a good waveform would still require new layout/extraction, numerical agreement and full operating-condition checks. See [response](docs/evidence/cdr-lowz8-buffer-response-20261114.json) and [corrected screen](docs/evidence/cdr-lowz8-xor-load-reduction-launch-20261114.json).
- **RC:** the swap-extended extraction is for an **archived alternative** DP8TSRAMDP256x16, not either vendor SRAM in the current chip. Apply independent topology/RC audit if it completes; never transfer its result to the current macro or claim qualified min/max RC.
- **Native MBIST:** the current full run includes system and Ethernet memories plus firmware handover; PCIe is idle and there is no SDF. Do not call it serial PHY or routed-timing proof.

## Completion remains unproven

Keep the full scope in [product acceptance](docs/92-product-acceptance.md), [second audit](docs/96-second-audit-closure.md) and the README. Outstanding work includes final setup/hold/electrical closure on the same routed chip, full current SRAM and chip LVS, qualified SRAM characterization/Liberty and min/max RC, full serial Gen3 x4 PHY/control/clock integration, integrated padframe/DFT and physical verification, manufacturing review, and the required silicon/radiation qualification. Historical pilot/core passes and scoped diagnostics do not close these requirements.

The previous checkpoint is retained below as history; its live-run statements and dates are not current.

# Claude handoff — terminal status update, 2026-11-04

Read [CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md](CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md) first for the detailed Turkish handover, exact sources, failures, measurements and next steps. Machine-readable selected evidence: [CLAUDE_HANDOFF_EVIDENCE.json](CLAUDE_HANDOFF_EVIDENCE.json).

At 2026-11-04 02:07 UTC, runs 41699812301, 41733225660, 41734419971 and corrected handoff 41739641054 were all completed/failure. No queued/in-progress runs were returned by the API. The old v360 live-status text below is historical.

- Route: supervisor memory-sample bounded-window failure; last successful RSS below limit. Route did not finish.
- Actual650 N1/N2: native transients exited zero; data/device/phase electrical gates failed.
- Handoff: original1691 scope correction passed its former failure point; DEF single-wire-clause parser now fails in prepare. Logical diode supplies passed; physical continuity unverified.
- Full serial PHY, completed mainchip routing, final timing and production acceptance remain open.

Documentation handoff only, not a new native experiment or v361 monitor rebuild. Native assets remain cloud-only. No CAD/simulation job dispatched for this handoff.

## Native route-class restoration and diode-inclusive netlist handoff

New source50f1ebf8d1c940abff985f971aeae670eeb4a9ec on codex/mainchip-postroute-handoff implements actual original full-chip class restoration, diode logical-supply audit, physical netlist export, fresh-library read/link and complete instance/pin/boundary incidence comparison. The old zero-diode route12 adapter and original timing gates remain unchanged. Source controls41738123187 passed, including six rejection cases; their1190-byte artifact13280920159 was authenticated in RAM.

Native job41738314531/release433325391 is the first real execution. Its initial input is the existing completed route41440285882, which still has known physical violations. It is a qualification of the handoff implementation, not the new full64 result and not signoff. It invokes no new routing. The complete real netlist comparison must pass, then native diode/port mutations must be rejected. Native failure must be diagnosed without silently omitting diodes/physical cells.

Current full64 route41699812301 and actual650 N1/N2 runs41733225660/41734419971 retain their exact handles. If the handoff implementation passes, acquire the completed full64 output with exact source/asset/member pins and apply it there before fresh RC/original-clock timing. Do not use the old zero-diode netlist. Original global class restoration and actual physical diode PG connectivity are distinct; the new logical supply check does not establish metal continuity or LVS.

The restored PLL terminal map and distinction between failed RHI120 and olderPLL845 captures remain documented in docs/pcie-cdr-pll-connection-audit-20261104.md. Current650 benches still use an external clock and do not prove a recovered-clock loop.

All earlier sources, complete reports and failed runs remain preserved.
All native CAD/geometry/runtime/electrical payloads stay cloud-only. The local
workspace is empty; source and derived-text API coordination uses RAM.
The8-hour monitor remains read-only with automatic_native_dispatch=false.
Poll existing exact handles; do not restart on observation timeouts.
Full serialPHY, completed mainchip routing and final setup/hold must all
pass real complete verification before the overall goal is complete.
