"""Generate the Tiny Tapeout submission tree (tt/) from this repository.

This repository is the single source of truth. Everything under tt/ is
derived: the RTL is copied byte for byte out of hw/rtl, the register
addresses in the datasheet come from sw/golden/regmap_gen.py (itself
generated from regmap/regmap.yaml), and the scaffolding is a recorded
port of the upstream Tiny Tapeout template. Nothing under tt/ is meant
to be hand-edited; a SHA-256 manifest is written so that drift in either
direction is detectable, and sw/tests/test_tt_submission.py fails the
build when it happens.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/gen_tt_submission.py            # write tt/
    python3 scripts/gen_tt_submission.py --check    # fail on drift, write nothing
    python3 scripts/gen_tt_submission.py --diff-template
                                                    # network: prove that the
                                                    # files this script claims
                                                    # are verbatim really are

# Tile shape. First set to 4x2 by docs/15-pilot-tile-plan.md section 4;
# moved to 6x2 by docs/23-tile-shape-decision.md.
#
# 4x2 is no longer viable on the planning criterion. docs/22 section 9
# measures the current design at 185,755 um2 placed into a 259,837 um2
# 4x2 core -- 71.489 % utilization against a 70 % criterion, i.e. 2.13 %
# of the core short. It still routed DRC-clean, so that is a planning
# failure rather than a flow failure, but it leaves no headroom at all.
#
# Twelve tiles come in two shapes at the same price, and docs/23 hardens
# both rather than scaling the 4x2 numbers. 6x2 wins: 47.29 %
# utilization, zero setup, hold, max-slew and max-cap violations on all
# three corners, detailed routing converged in a single pass of five
# iterations, zero antenna diodes required. 3x4 buys 5.4 points more
# utilization headroom that the design does not need, and pays for it
# with one 6.27 ps hold violation at the fast corner, a second
# detailed-route pass, and a purchasability on TTIHP26b that could not be
# confirmed -- tile_sizes.yaml and the shuttle's own pinned DEF set carry
# 3x4, but the ttihp-verilog-template info.yaml comment lists no

# LibreLane configuration overrides
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# CORRECTED 2026-08-26. This block used to be empty, on the reasoning
# that "the replicas are not merged, because Yosys opt_merge does not
# merge flip-flops unless asked with -share_all". That reasoning was
# wrong and the measurement behind it was misread. opt_merge does not
# merge bit-level flip-flops on its own, but `opt_dff` first normalises
# the three identically-written replicas into identical enable
# flip-flops, and opt_merge then hashes THOSE into one bank. The
# artifact proves it: the netlist that fed the 4x2 harden,
# tt/runs/tt-harden/06-yosys-synthesis/tt_um_melihakbulut_nssoc.nl.v,
# has 362 references to `cfg_a[` and zero to `cfg_b[` or `cfg_c[`.
# The earlier `(* keep *)` experiment reported "the same 1036" because the
# attribute preserves the WIRE name while the storage still merges --
# the flip-flop count never moved, which is the number that mattered.
#
# hw/rtl/pilot_top.v header section 9 now builds each replica as a
# `pilot_cfg_bank` instance carrying `keep_hierarchy`, so this design
# is in exactly the position the sibling edge-AI project is in: under
# the LibreLane default SYNTH_HIERARCHY_MODE ("flatten",
# librelane/steps/pyosys.py) the three instances survive into the mapped
# netlist as derived module types whose names begin with `$paramod`, and
# the Checker.YosysUnmappedCells step counts every cell type starting
# with `$` as an unmapped instance (librelane/steps/pyosys.py, the
# design__instance_unmapped__count metric). The GDS action would abort.
#
# "deferred_flatten" is the documented answer and the one the sibling
# programme runs through GDS: LibreLane resynthesizes the already-mapped
# netlist with `synth -flatten`, which removes the hierarchy AFTER the
# banks are standard cells, so nothing can hash them together. Measured
# here on sg13g2 with the repository's own Yosys 0.33, using the
# standalone recipe of sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py: 1155
# flip-flops, 55 under each of u_cfg_a / u_cfg_b / u_cfg_c, and no cell
# type beginning with `$` left in the netlist. That recipe is not
# byte-for-byte LibreLane -- before the fix it read 1045 where the real
# 4x2 run read 1037 -- which is exactly why the guard test measures its
# own recipe rather than asserting a hardcoded LibreLane number.
#
# sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py is the check that keeps this true.

    # The six keys below are what makes this design meet timing, and
    # until 2026-08-31 not one of them was in the submission path. That
    # was a shipping defect rather than a missing optimisation, and
    # docs/31 measured it rather than inferring it: hardening the
    # submission configuration on this RTL misses the slow corner by
    # -1.8321 ns derated, on 18 violating endpoints -- and the flow
    # reports that run CLEAN, because without SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS the
    # setup checker examines only the typical corner, which passes at
    # +6.8753. The adopted configuration is worth 3.0588 ns on the same
    # sources and the shuttle would have taken none of it.
    #
    # What each key is worth individually is in docs/28; the sign-off
    # that proves the combination is docs/31.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # A float deliberately: the PDKs ship this as the integer 5 and
    # LibreLane divides it with Tcl integer division, so an integer here

    # ships as ["*"], so only setup was ever exposed.

    # above: those buy timing margin, these buy no margin at all. They
    # close two checkers that could not fail a run.
    #
    # Checker.MaxCapViolations and Checker.MaxSlewViolations each declare
    # corner_override = [""] in librelane/steps/checker.py, and
    # TimingViolations.get_corner_variable() turns that into the DEFAULT
    # of the two keys below. The mechanism is NOT the
    # SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS one: [""] is a non-empty list, so the `or`
    # in get_corner_wildcards() is already satisfied and these two never
    # consult TIMING_VIOLATION_CORNERS at all. The list is then stripped
    # of the "" match-none wildcard, comes out empty, matches no corner,
    # and every violation lands in warn_violating_corner -- the step
    # warns and the flow exits 0. Neither PDK ships either key, so the
    # design configuration is the only thing that can bind them.
    #
    # Third instance of the shape docs/28 section 4.4a named, after setup
    # and after docs/23's design__violations not aggregating hold.
    # docs/34 section 8.5 measured it and deferred it to the far side of
    # the freeze; docs/36 closes it. On ihp-sg13g2 this design is 0 at

This is a sample testbench for a Tiny Tapeout project. It uses [cocotb](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/) to drive the DUT and check the outputs.
See below to get started or for more information, check the [website](https://tinytapeout.com/hdl/testing/).

## Setting up

1. Edit [Makefile](Makefile) and modify `PROJECT_SOURCES` to point to your Verilog files.
2. Edit [tb.v](tb.v) and replace `tt_um_example` with your module name.

## How to run

To run the RTL simulation:

```sh
make -B
```

To run gatelevel simulation, first harden your project and copy `../runs/wokwi/results/final/verilog/gl/{your_module_name}.v` to `gate_level_netlist.v`.

Then run:

```sh
make -B GATES=yes
```

If you wish to save the waveform in VCD format instead of FST format, edit tb.v to use `$dumpfile("tb.vcd");` and then run:

```sh
make -B FST=
```

This will generate `tb.vcd` instead of `tb.fst`.

## How to view the waveform file

Using GTKWave

```sh
gtkwave tb.fst tb.gtkw
```

Using Surfer

```sh
surfer tb.fst
```

## A note on gate-level simulation with a distribution Icarus

`make -B GATES=yes` needs more than stock Icarus Verilog. The
`ihp-sg13g2` standard-cell simulation models drive their outputs from
`delayed_D`, `delayed_CLK` and `delayed_RESET_B`, which are the
negative-timing-check outputs of `$setuphold` and `$recrem`. A simulator
that does not implement those leaves the delayed signals undriven, and
Icarus says so:

```
warning: Timing checks are not supported and delayed signal "delayed_CLK" will not be driven.
```

Every flip-flop output is then stuck at `x` for the whole simulation.
The symptom is not a crash: the design simply reads back zeros, so it
looks like a broken netlist rather than a broken model.

Measured on this project with Icarus 12.0 (stable) and the netlist from
a completed local harden: 1 of 5 tests passes. Driving the delayed
signals from their undelayed sources in a scratch copy of
`sg13g2_stdcell.v` and changing nothing else: 5 of 5 pass, matching the
RTL run exactly.

The Tiny Tapeout `gl_test` workflow does not have this problem - it
installs `TinyTapeout/iverilog` v13.0 rather than a distribution build.
If you want to run gate-level simulation locally, use that build.

Where the netlist comes from: `gate_level_netlist.v` is not checked in
and nothing in this repository produces it. Either take it from the GDS
action's `tt_submission` artifact, or copy it out of a local harden:

```sh
cp ../runs/wokwi/final/nl/<top_module>.nl.v gate_level_netlist.v
```

Delete it when you are done. A stale netlist left in place makes
`GATES=yes` silently test the previous revision.

## How it works

{TITLE.split(' ', 1)[0]} is the pilot test chip of a fault-tolerant neuromorphic
system-on-chip for small-satellite missions. It is one node slice of that
architecture, shrunk to a Tiny Tapeout block, and it carries the parts
that are worth measuring on real silicon rather than in simulation.

**The datapath.** An 8 x 8 leaky integrate-and-fire crossbar: eight
neurons, eight axons, 64 four-bit signed synapses held in flip-flops.
Events arrive as SPIKE or TICK words. A SPIKE accumulates the addressed
axon's weight column into every neuron's membrane potential; a TICK
applies the leak, compares against the threshold, emits an event for
every neuron that fired, resets it and starts its refractory count. The
arithmetic is bit-exact against a Python reference model in the source
repository, checked event by event and neuron by neuron.

**Fault tolerance, on the real datapath rather than beside it.** Three
mechanisms, all observable from outside with nothing but an
oscilloscope:

- *SECDED.* The 64-bit weight word that software writes is the data
  field of a physically stored (72, 64) Hsiao codeword. On commit the
  check field is computed, the armed `ECC_INJ` pattern is XORed into the
  stored codeword, the decoder runs, and the weight loader writes the 16
  weights into the crossbar *from the decoder output*. A corrected
  single-bit upset therefore never reaches the datapath, and an
  uncorrectable word contributes zero weight instead of garbage. The
  injected error survives in the stored word, so the same fault can be
  re-checked from the `SCRUB_STB` pin as often as you like;
  `ECC_INJ_POS` moves the injected bit anywhere in the 72-bit codeword,
  so the whole syndrome space is walkable on silicon.
- *TMR.* Every configuration bit that reaches the crossbar - threshold,
  reset potential, leak, synaptic shift, refractory period, the flag
  bits and the tile offset, 55 bits in total - is held in three replicas
  and voted before it leaves the register block. `TMR_INJ` holds one bit
  of one replica wrong. Software still reads the voted value, the
  inference still produces exactly the same spike stream, and `CNT_TMR`
  and the TMR pin still record that it happened.
- *Control-state upsets.* The neuron core's control state machine is
  encoded in five words that are pairwise at Hamming distance 2, so a
  single-bit upset in that register always produces a word no legal
  transition can make. The core then parks in a safe state, freezes the
  neuron state file, refuses further work, and raises `STATUS.ERR_CFG`
  and the ERR pin. A bench measuring upset rates sees the event on a
  pin, with no polling. While the core is parked the bit cannot be
  cleared - `STATUS_CLR` will not report a live fault as gone.
  `CTRL.SOFT_RST` is the recovery: it restarts the core and keeps both
  the configuration and the neuron state. The bit survives that reset,
  so recovering before you poll does not lose the event; `STATUS_CLR`
  then clears it.

Four of the eight dedicated outputs are fault pins (ERR, SEC, DED, TMR).
That is deliberate: every hardening event is visible on a scope with no
host software running, which is what a bench measuring upset rates
actually needs.

**Honest limits.** Three, and every one of them matters to somebody
measuring this part:

- The TMR injector drives a replica's read path, not its storage
  flip-flop, so there is no replica resynchronization on this chip. A
  configuration rewrite restores all three replicas.
- The fault counters are 8 bits and saturate, rather than the 32 bits of
  the architecture's register map. At a high event rate, read them
  often.
- There is no SRAM macro and no management processor on this die. The
  chip is driven from the serial port, which is what a bring-up board
  does anyway.

## How to test

### Talking to the chip

The host port is a mode-0 SPI slave (CPOL 0, CPHA 0), MSB first, one
register per frame. A frame is 40 `SER_SCK` cycles: a command byte
`{{WR, ADDR[6:0]}}` followed by 32 data bits. `ADDR[6:0]` is the register
offset in the tables below shifted right by two.

Reads: the addressed register is captured when the command byte
completes and shifted out on the following falling edges, so the host
samples data bit 31 on `SER_SCK` cycle 9. Read side effects (the
`EVQ_OUT` pop) happen once, at that capture. Writes commit on the 40th
rising edge, not at `CS_N` release, so an aborted frame changes nothing.

Three host obligations, and all three are real - each one is held at its
boundary value by the regression suite:

1. `SER_SCK` at most `clk`/4. The serial port lives entirely in the
   `clk` domain behind two-flop synchronizers.
2. `SER_CS_N` must fall at least one full `SER_SCK` period **before** the
   first `SER_SCK` edge. A host that drops the select and clocks
   immediately risks losing the first command bit.
3. `SER_CS_N` must stay high at least one full `SER_SCK` period
   **between** frames. The bit counter is held at zero only while the
   synchronized select reads inactive, so a deselect that is never seen
   leaves the counter running and the next frame decodes at the wrong
   offset. This was found during bring-up with a half-period gap.

### First contact

Read offset 0x000. It returns `0x4E505531` (ASCII "NPU1"). If it does
not, check obligations 1 to 3 before suspecting the chip.

### A minimal inference

1. Write `CFG_AXON` = 8, and the neuron parameters (`CFG_THRESH`,
   `CFG_VRESET`, `CFG_LEAK`, `CFG_SYNSHIFT`, `CFG_REFR`).
2. Load weights: for each of the four weight words, write `W_ADDR`, then
   `W_DATA_LO`, then `W_DATA_HI`. The `W_DATA_HI` write commits the
   72-bit codeword and auto-increments `W_ADDR`.
3. Write `CTRL.EN` = 1.
4. Push events: either write 16-bit event words to `EVQ_IN` over the
   serial port, or strobe them in on the pins - put the axon id on
   `uio[3:0]`, set `AER_IN_TICK` for a TICK or clear it for a SPIKE, and
   pulse `AER_IN_STB`. Watch `AER_IN_RDY` for backpressure.
5. Read results: poll `EVQ_STAT` and read `EVQ_OUT`, or watch
   `AER_OUT_VLD` and read the emitted neuron id off `uio[7:4]`, then
   pulse `AER_OUT_ACK`. Neuron state is readable at any time through
   `N_ADDR` / `N_DATA`.

### Exercising the fault tolerance

**Single-bit ECC correction.** Write `ECC_INJ_POS` with a bit position
0..71, write `ECC_INJ` with the SINGLE bit set, then commit a weight word
(`W_ADDR`, `W_DATA_LO`, `W_DATA_HI`). The SEC pin goes high, `CNT_SEC`
increments, and the weights that reach the crossbar are the correct ones
- run the inference and compare. The corrupted codeword stays corrupted,
so pulsing `SCRUB_STB` re-runs the check as often as you want. Set
`CTRL.SCRUB_EN` first and each check writes the repaired word back
instead, after which the SEC pin stops firing on that word.

**Double-bit ECC detection.** Same sequence with the DOUBLE bit of
`ECC_INJ` set. The DED pin goes high, `CNT_DED` increments,
`FAULT_ADDR` holds the offending weight-word index, and those 16 weights
contribute zero to the inference rather than a wrong value.

**TMR masking.** Write `TMR_INJ` with a replica selector (01, 10 or 11)
and a bit index 0..54. The TMR pin goes high and `CNT_TMR` increments,
while the voted configuration reads back correct and the spike stream is
bit-identical to the uncorrupted run. Clear it by writing `TMR_INJ` = 0
or by rewriting the configuration register.

**Control-state upsets.** There is no injection hook for this one, and
that is the honest position: a fault injector for the neuron core's own
state register would be logic that only exists to be wrong. On a bench
it is what you are waiting to see. If an upset lands in that register,
the core parks, `STATUS.ERR_CFG` and the ERR pin go high and stay high,
`STATUS.BUSY` stays high because the core never returns to idle, and no
further event is processed. `STATUS_CLR` will not clear it while the
core is parked. Recover with `CTRL.SOFT_RST`: the configuration and the
neuron state survive and the core runs again, but `STATUS.ERR_CFG` and
the ERR pin stay high so the event is not lost by recovering from it.
Clear them with `STATUS_CLR` once it is recorded.

**Clearing.** `FAULT_CLR` is a write-1-to-clear mask, one bit per
counter, in the architecture register map's order:

| Bit | Clears |
|---|---|
| 0 | `CNT_SEC`, and the SEC pin |
| 1 | `CNT_DED` |
| 2 | `CNT_EVQ_OVF` |
| 3 | `CNT_AXON_OOR` |
| 4 | `FAULT_ADDR` |
| 5 | `CNT_TMR`, and the TMR pin (pilot-only, see below) |

Bits 0 to 4 are the architecture register map's own assignment. Bit 5 is
this pilot's, because `CNT_TMR` is a pilot-only register and the map
leaves bits 5 and up unassigned. Writing `0x3F` clears everything.
`STATUS_CLR` clears the sticky `STATUS` bits, and with them the DED pin;
the ERR pin follows `STATUS.ERR_CFG` and `STATUS.OVF_SEEN`.

### Register map

Offsets are byte offsets; the serial command byte carries the offset
shifted right by two. `W1C` = write one to clear, `WO` = write only,
`RO` = read only.

{_reg_table(addr, access)}

Three registers exist only on this pilot. They sit in the unmapped
region of the same window and do not change the architecture's register
map:

{_pilot_only_table()}

`W_BASE` and `PASS_ID` of the architecture register map are not
implemented here: both are multi-pass sequencer bookkeeping with no
hardware effect in a single-pass build. They read as zero and reject
writes, like any other unmapped offset.

### Pinout detail

Dedicated inputs:

{_pin_table(PINOUT_UI, "ui")}

Dedicated outputs:

{_pin_table(PINOUT_UO, "uo")}

Bidirectionals. `uio_oe` is fixed at `0xF0` in the design, so `uio[3:0]`
are always inputs and `uio[7:4]` are always outputs:

| Pin | Direction | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| uio[3:0] | input | AER_IN_ADDR | Axon id of the strobed event |
| uio[7:4] | output | AER_OUT_ID | Emitted neuron id |

The full 16-bit event word is always readable over `EVQ_OUT`; the uio
nibble is the low four bits of its id field, for a consumer that wants
the event stream without a host.

### The full regression

`test/` in this repository holds a self-contained cocotb smoke test that
runs without any of the source repository. The complete suite - 21
cocotb tests driving this exact port list, plus a bit-exact Python
reference model, plus SymbiYosys proofs of the event queue, the voter
and the SECDED codec - lives in the source repository.

## External hardware

An SPI master. Any microcontroller board with a mode-0 SPI peripheral
will do, and the demo board's RP2040 is enough. A logic analyser or
oscilloscope on the four fault pins is useful but not required. No
external memory, no level shifting, no other hardware.

# {TITLE}

Tiny Tapeout TTIHP26b submission, {TILES} tiles, IHP SG13G2.

- Datasheet source: [docs/info.md](docs/info.md)
- Top module: `{TOP_MODULE}`

## Status

The design has been taken through a full local LibreLane `Classic` run
at {TILES} against this repository's own `src/config_merged.json`. It closes
at 47.29 % utilization with zero detailed-route DRC errors, zero Magic
DRC errors, zero KLayout DRC errors, zero Netgen LVS errors, zero antenna
violations, and zero setup, hold, max-cap and max-slew violations across
all three PVT corners. The tile shape was chosen on measured area, and
re-chosen when the design outgrew the first choice: placed, the design is
185,840 um2 of standard cells, which overruns the 70 % planning criterion
in a 4x2 core of 259,837 um2. Both twelve-tile shapes were then hardened
rather than estimated, and {TILES} won. Full working in
`docs/15-pilot-tile-plan.md` and `docs/23-tile-shape-decision.md` in the
source repository.

That local run is evidence, not a substitute for the GDS action and the
Tiny Tapeout precheck, which are what actually gate a submission.

source repository as well, so what is hardened is what is simulated
there.

## Scaffolding provenance

`.github/`, `.devcontainer/`, `.vscode/`, `src/config.json`,
`test/Makefile`, `test/tb.v` and `test/requirements.txt`
are ported from the upstream Tiny Tapeout template:

    {TEMPLATE_URL}
    commit {TEMPLATE_COMMIT}

`src/config.json` is byte-identical to upstream. Running
`scripts/gen_tt_submission.py --diff-template` in the source repository
re-fetches the template and proves that claim for every file that carries
it.

## Licence

Two licences, because this tree has two origins.

* **The design sources in `src/`** are `CERN-OHL-W-2.0`, the full text
  of which is in `LICENSE`. They are copied byte for byte out of
  `hw/rtl/` in the source repository and carry their SPDX tag from
  there.
* **The scaffolding listed above** stays `Apache-2.0` as received from
  the upstream template; its text is in `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`.

The decision behind the split is `docs/14-licensing-decision.md` in the
source repository, signed 2026-09-09.

## Running the tests

```sh
cd test
make -B
```

Requires `iverilog` and the packages in `test/requirements.txt`.

TEST_PY_TEMPLATE = '''"""Self-contained smoke test for the Tiny Tapeout submission.

GENERATED by scripts/gen_tt_submission.py in the neuromorphic-space-soc
repository. Do not edit here; edit the source repository and regenerate.

This file deliberately does NOT import the source repository's golden
model: a submission repository has to be testable on its own, and the
Tiny Tapeout `test` workflow checks out nothing else. What it covers is
the part that a broken port map, a broken pin contract or a broken host
protocol would break, and that a datasheet reader would hit first:

  * reset leaves uio_oe at 0xF0 and every fault pin quiescent
  * the identity register reads back over the serial port
  * a write/read round trip through SCRATCH
  * the read-only rule (a write to VERSION changes nothing)
  * an end-to-end event: weights loaded through the SECDED codec, one
    SPIKE strobed in on the AER pins, the neuron id read off uio[7:4],
    and the pin-side acknowledge retiring the entry

The full regression - bit-exact inference against a Python reference
model, the SECDED syndrome walk, the double-bit E10 substitution, the
scrub loop and the TMR masking proof - lives in the source repository
and runs against this same port list.
