"""Attribute every box in a Magic DRC report to a macro, or to nothing.

    classify_magic_drc.py <run-dir> [--lef-dir DIR]

`docs/12` section 7.5 measured RM_IHPSG13 as un-signoff-able in this PDK
version: 1,106,478 Magic errors inside ONE macro's own footprint and 0
outside. Every Magic result in this repository is therefore read as two
numbers, inside and outside, and never as a total. The classifications
in `hw/soc/pnr/runs/*/classification.txt` were produced by a script that
was never committed, so the numbers `docs/77` and `paper/main.tex` cite
could not be re-derived from this checkout. This is that script.

It reads the run's own final DEF for macro origins and orientations and
the PDK LEF for macro sizes, so it cannot be told a placement that the
run did not have. Two extents are reported because they answer different
questions: the LEF footprint is the box the floorplan reserves, and the
drawn extent adds the 0.225um NWell overhang the vendor's geometry
actually occupies, which is what decides whether a box on a macro edge
belongs to the macro or to the design.

# Measured 2026-09-13 on the eight-macro layout: 31 of the 33 boxes this
# constant turns into "straddling" overlap by EXACTLY 0.0050um, at three
# different macro right edges -- 904.48, 1729.12 and 2006.08 -- so the
# markers sit 0.220um from the LEF edge and this 0.225 model overshoots
# them by five nanometres. Change the constant to 0.220 and all 31 become
# "outside". The drawn-extent split is therefore decided by a modelling
# choice of 5nm, and the LEF-footprint split above it is the robust
# number. That is why this script prints both and lists the marginal
# boxes rather than picking one.
