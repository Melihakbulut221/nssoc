#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT IS NOT CONVENIENCE
#
# Three documents said these checks "run in CI". They did not, and the
# reason recorded here was WRONG IN THE DIRECTION THAT MATTERS.
#
# *Corrected 2026-09-11.* This read: "Every workflow run on this
# repository since 2026-09-03 was refused before starting -- '(account status, not published)' -- so the SPDX policy check has
# never executed there once, and neither has the paper's claim checker.
# Nine non-starts, not nine failures."
#
# 53 of 61 runs in that window EXECUTED. The licence job among them
# failed, and it failed on `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'`
# -- an uninstalled dependency, not a billing wall. One day's refusals
# were read backwards across a week, which turned a fixable workflow
# defect into an account problem nobody could act on.
#
# And the billing wall that does exist is in front of PRIVATE minutes
# only. The public mirror's first push started a run six seconds later.
# So "CI cannot run" was never true of a public repository, which is
# what a Tiny Tapeout submission is.
#
# THE WORKFLOWS NOW CALL THIS SCRIPT. That is the point of it. One
# definition of what a check is, so "CI runs the checks" and "I ran the
# checks" cannot drift apart, and so the checks keep working while the
# runner does not.
#
# A SKIP IS NOT A PASS. Two things genuinely cannot run on the machine
# this project is developed on -- there is no TeX and no pandoc, and apt
# needs a password -- so they report SKIP with the reason, and the
# summary prints the count. A runner that reported green while silently
# not building the paper would be the exact defect this repository
# keeps finding in itself.

#
# THE INSTRUMENT THAT FINDS INSTRUMENTS THAT CANNOT FAIL, and until
# 2026-09-10 it was called by nothing.
#
# hw/openlane/checker_audit.py was written for docs/36 to detect one
# specific shape: a LibreLane Checker.* step that runs, reports green and
# gates nothing, because its reach is configuration and the configuration
# is not visible in any report. It found that shape three times in this
# tree. It was then never wired to a runner, and so it did not find the
# fourth: hw/openlane/aer_fifo/config.json carried none of the three keys
# and ROADMAP gate G0's evidence run, trial-03-signoff, had setup bound
# to the typical corner alone and max cap and max slew bound to the
# match-none empty string. A detector nothing calls is the same defect
# one level up. This job calls it.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT "exit 0".
#
# checker_audit.py exits 1 whenever ANY in-flow checker is PARTIAL or
# NO-GATE, and two of them always are, by disposition rather than by
# oversight: Checker.LintWarnings is off by an explicitly named boolean
# whose default upstream chose (docs/36 section 3.3), and
# Checker.WireLength has no WIRE_LENGTH_THRESHOLD in either PDK (docs/36
# section 3.4). docs/71 section 9 corrected five documents that had
# written "exit 0" for exactly this reason. So the exit status is not
# the gate here.
#
# The gate is the SET. For each run tree below, the checkers that do not
# gate must be exactly the ones dispositioned in the table, in the order
# checker_audit.py prints them. That fails in BOTH directions on purpose:
# a checker that stops gating fails the job, and a disposition that
# quietly disappears also fails it, because a shrinking list is a green
# result getting wider without anyone saying so. Adding a row, or
# changing one, is a deliberate edit with a reason next to it.
#
# THE TWO UNBOUND RUN TREES ARE IN THE TABLE ON PURPOSE. sky-14-6x2-rcmodel
# is the script's own self-test -- its docstring says so -- and it is the
# only place in this repository where a real, non-synthetic violation sits
# at a corner the wildcards do not reach: 3,930 max-slew violations
# reported as a clean flow. trial-03-signoff is the G0 evidence run, left
# standing with its marker rather than re-run (docs/64). If either ever
# reports a full set of gates, the run tree has been replaced by something
# else and the job says so.
#
# A SKIP IS NOT A PASS here either. Run trees under hw/openlane/*/runs
# and hw/soc/pnr/runs are gitignored, so a fresh clone has none of them,
# and checker_audit.py imports librelane, which the repository venv does
# not carry -- it needs the flow venv, whose path its own docstring gives
# and which FLOW_PY overrides.
