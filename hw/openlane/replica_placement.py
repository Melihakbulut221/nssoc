"""How far apart the TMR replicas actually are on the die.

    python3 hw/openlane/replica_placement.py <run-dir> [--json]

WHY THIS EXISTS

`sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py` counts mapped flip-flops by instance
path and asserts three banks of 55. That is the instrument `docs/33`
built after the synthesiser merged the three replicas into one, and it
is the right instrument for a *synthesis* event. It establishes LOGICAL
redundancy: three banks exist in the netlist.

It says nothing about where they are. A majority vote over three
registers placed in adjacent rows is defeated by whatever corrupts two
adjacent registers, and nothing in this flow asks the placer to keep
them apart. Until this script there was no measurement either way, and
"the configuration state is protected by TMR" was being read as a
statement about the die when the evidence was about the netlist.

It is the same shape as the defect that motivated the census, one
abstraction level down: a check that passes, read wider than what it
looked at. The guard runs on the synthesis netlist and CANNOT see
placement, by construction -- a guard must sit at the stage that can
satisfy it.

WHAT IT MEASURES

Cell bounding boxes from the run's own final DEF, in micrometres:

  * centre-to-centre and edge-to-edge distance for every cross-replica
    flip-flop pair;
  * the same restricted to CORRESPONDING BITS, which is the pairing an
    upset must corrupt two of;
  * how many pairs abut, share a row, or sit within one site pitch;
  * where each bank sits, and whether a flop's nearest neighbour is in
    its own replica or another one.

WHAT IT DOES NOT MEASURE, AND THIS IS NOT A DETAIL

A distance is not a safety argument. No SEU or MBU cross-section,
charge-collection radius or LET threshold for IHP SG13G2 was measured
or is available here, and these are cell bounding boxes rather than
sensitive nodes. The numbers establish that a layout PERMITS a
common-mode upset of two replicas; they do not say one occurs at any
fluence, and they do not say what separation would prevent one.
