"""Generate a corner-experiment variant of config.json.

Written for the docs/20 PNR_CORNERS experiments. A variant must be
byte-identical to the baseline except for a small, named set of keys,
otherwise a difference in the result cannot be attributed to the knob
under test. Hand-copying a 60-key config invites exactly that drift, so
the variants are generated: this script reads config.json, applies one
named delta from the table below, and writes config.<name>.json beside
the baseline.

Beside it on purpose. Every `dir::` path in config.json -- the RTL
sources, the include directory, the pin-frame DEF template -- resolves
relative to the directory holding the config file. A variant written
anywhere else would resolve to different files without erroring.

The `//variant` key it emits records the delta in the artefact itself,
so a run directory's resolved.json is self-describing.

Usage:
    ./mkvariant.py pnrcorners
    ./mkvariant.py --list

    # prefixes in TECH_LEFS. But OpenROAD's ODB holds exactly one
    # technology, read once by `13-openroad-floorplan` and carried in the
    # ODB from there, and the one it reads is `nom` (DEFAULT_CORNER is
    # `nom_tt_025C_1v80`). So the `max` interconnect model is not present
    # inside place-and-route at all, for any step, whatever PNR_CORNERS,
    # RSZ_CORNERS or CTS_CORNERS say. LAYERS_RC is the only channel
    # through which a per-corner wire RC can enter PnR.
    #
    # The values below are the three tech LEFs' own RPERSQ /
    # CPERSQDIST / EDGECAPACITANCE, converted by exactly the formula
    # `set_layers_default_rc` in `librelane/scripts/openroad/common/set_rc.tcl`
    # applies to the one LEF it has -- res = RPERSQ / WIDTH in kohm/um,
    # cap = CPERSQDIST * WIDTH + 2 * EDGECAPACITANCE in pF/um. So this
    # variant hands PnR the data the PDK already ships and the flow
    # already knows how to read; it does not invent a corner.

    # docs/25 section 7. The upper bound: the best wire model the PDK's
    # own data supports, all three known terms at once. It is deliberately
    # a bundle and not a single-variable arm -- the 6x2-layersrc run above
    # isolates the corner term, and this one answers the different
    # question of whether the parasitic model is the WHOLE story.
    #
    # Term 2, layer mix. `set_wire_rc` averages over the constrained
    # routing layers and `14-openroad-dumprcvalues` prints what that
    # average is: Signal Avg 4.402703e-04 kohm/um. The design does not
    # route that way -- at 6x2 it puts 190,189 um on met1 and 159,961 um
    # on met2 against 75,808 um on met3 and 6,454 um on met4, so 81.0 % of
    # its length is on the two layers that are 5.70x more resistive than
    # the other two, and the usage-weighted figure is 7.528e-04. The
    # estimate is 1.71x optimistic. Restricting SIGNAL_WIRE_RC_LAYERS to
    # met1 and met2 gives 8.929e-04.
    #
    # Term 3, vias. `resizer_values_after.rpt` reports every via cut
    # resistance as 0.000000e+00, while the tech LEF declares mcon 9.30,
    # via 4.50, via2 3.41 and via3 3.41 (kohm) and the 6x2 route contains
    # 76,686 vias. `RCX_MERGE_VIA_WIRE_RES` is true, so extraction charges
    # them and PnR does not. VIAS_R is the only lever on this.
    #
    # VIAS_R is applied under "*" and not per corner ON PURPOSE. In
    # LibreLane 3.0.5 `openroad.py:407` passes the VIAS_R corner wildcard
    # to `Filter()` as a bare string where `LAYERS_RC` at :400 passes
    # `Filter([wildcard])`; `Filter.__init__` iterates its argument, so a
    # string wildcard is split per character and any wildcard containing
    # `*` then matches every corner. Verified directly. So the nom values
    # are used, which is the tech LEF the ODB actually carries; the
    # nom-to-max via spread (mcon 9.30 -> 23.0) stays unmodelled and
    # docs/25 section 7 says so.
