"""Audit every LibreLane checker in a run: does it gate, and on what?

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Three times in this project a checker has been found green because it
was looking at nothing:

  * `docs/23`  -- `design__violations` does not aggregate hold, so a
    hold violation did not reach the flow's own summary metric.
  * `docs/28` section 4.4a -- `Checker.SetupViolations` resolves its
    corners as `SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS or TIMING_VIOLATION_CORNERS`,
    both PDKs ship `["*typ*"]`, and the first key was unset. Setup had
    never been checked at the slow corner. Four published "the corner
    closes" claims came from runs that did not gate it.
  * `docs/34` section 8.5, closed by `docs/36` -- `MAX_CAP_VIOLATION_CORNERS`
    and `MAX_SLEW_VIOLATION_CORNERS` both resolve to the match-none
    wildcard `[""]`, so both checkers warn and can never fail.

The common shape is that a checker's *reach* is configuration, the
configuration's default is not visible in any report, and a run that
gates nothing looks exactly like a run that gates everything and
passes. Prose cannot keep up with that: the answer changes with the
LibreLane version, with the PDK, and with the design's own config. So
it is computed here instead, from the installed LibreLane's own step
classes and from the run's own `resolved.json`.

WHAT IT REPORTS
---------------
For every `Checker.*` step registered by the installed LibreLane, and
for every one of those the Classic flow actually runs:

  * how the checker is gated -- by a boolean `ERROR_ON_*` variable, by
    a numeric threshold, or by a list of corner wildcards;
  * the value that binds in THIS run;
  * the metric it reads and that metric's value;
  * a verdict -- GATES, PARTIAL or NO-GATE -- with the reason.

PARTIAL is the `docs/28` 4.4a shape exactly: the wildcard list is not
empty, but it matches fewer corners than the metric was measured at, so
the checker is green over a subset. Where violations sit at a corner
the wildcards do not reach, the line ends in `WARNS ONLY, DOES NOT
FAIL`. Pointed at `sky-14-6x2-rcmodel` the script reproduces that
finding from the run alone, which is the self-test for this file.

NO-GATE is not automatically a defect. `Checker.LintWarnings` is off by
an explicitly named boolean whose default upstream chose; that is a
policy, not an oversight. What the script guarantees is that no such
case is invisible.

Exit status is 1 if any in-flow checker is PARTIAL or NO-GATE, so this
is usable as a gate in its own right once the remaining cases are
dispositioned.

Run it with the FLOW's interpreter, not the repository venv -- it
imports librelane:

    ~/Documents/caravel-lif-crossbar/.venv-flow/bin/python \\
        hw/openlane/checker_audit.py hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/<tag>

With two or more run directories it prints one block each, which is how
a PDK-to-PDK or before-to-after comparison is made.
