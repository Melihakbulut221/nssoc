"""Derive the docs/28 timing-recovery variants from the 6x2 submission config.

The docs/27 re-harden left the slow-corner setup margin at +0.3229 ns,
1.61 % of a 20 ns cycle. docs/28 attributes that loss and then measures
what each recovery option is worth. Every option is one or two keys
changed against `config.6x2.json` and nothing else, so a difference in
any other sign-off number is itself a finding -- the same discipline
`mkconfig.py` applies to the shape and corner variants.

The variants are DERIVED here rather than hand-written for the reason
`mkconfig.py` gives: `config.6x2.json` is itself generated from
`tt/src/config_merged.json`, so a hand-edited variant would drift from
the submission's own geometry the moment the submission moved.

Every variant also carries SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS = ["*"]. That is not
a timing experiment, it is a sign-off hole. LibreLane resolves the setup
checker's corners as `SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS or TIMING_VIOLATION_CORNERS`
(librelane/steps/checker.py, `get_corner_wildcards`), the IHP PDK ships
TIMING_VIOLATION_CORNERS = ["*typ*"], and SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS is
unset -- so `Checker.SetupViolations` has only ever checked the TYPICAL
corner, while HOLD_VIOLATION_CORNERS is already ["*"]. The slow corner
this document is about is not gated by any checker in the baseline.
docs/23 records the mirror-image of exactly this: a hold violation that
`design__violations` did not aggregate. Raising it costs nothing when
the corner passes and fails the run when it does not, which is the
point.

Usage:
    ./mktiming.py            # write the five variants
    ./mktiming.py --check    # re-derive and diff against disk

# The sign-off configuration, derived from config.json rather than from
# config.6x2.json
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The seven variants above are all derived from `config.6x2.json`, which
# was generated by `mkconfig.py` BEFORE two flow defects were fixed in
# `config.json`:
#
#   * `TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT: 5.0`. The PDK ships the integer 5 and
#     LibreLane's base.sdc consumes it with Tcl integer division, so
#     `expr 5 / 100` is 0 and the flow applied NO derate while logging
#     "5%". docs/28 section 4.4b. Written as a float, the division is
#     real and the late factor is 1.05.
#   * `SETUP_VIOLATION_CORNERS: ["*"]`. Both PDKs ship
#     `TIMING_VIOLATION_CORNERS: ["*typ*"]`, so with the key unset
#     `Checker.SetupViolations` gated the typical corner and nothing
#     else. docs/28 section 4.4a.
#
# `config.6x2.json` carries NEITHER, so a variant derived from it would
# harden without the derate and would gate setup at the typical corner
# only -- i.e. it would reproduce exactly the two defects docs/28
# reported. The sign-off variant is therefore derived from `config.json`,
# which carries both, and the four adopted timing keys are added on top.
#
# The four keys are docs/28 section 6.2's adopted set, verbatim. Nothing
# is added to buy margin: `PL_TIMING_DRIVEN` is worth +0.5856 ns on its
# own (docs/28 section 5.5) and is deliberately NOT here, because
# composing it with the post-GRT repair has never been hardened and
# docs/28 section 10 item 9 names that as the untested experiment. This
# document does not adopt a knob it has not measured either.
#
# Two decks are switched on that the submission config leaves off:
# RUN_KLAYOUT_DRC and RUN_KLAYOUT_XOR. Neither changes a layout bit --
# they are read-only decks over the streamed GDS -- and both are run by
# the Tiny Tapeout precheck, where a failure costs a resubmission round
# rather than half an hour of local machine time. docs/20 section 11 is
# the precedent for the DRC deck; the XOR has never been run in this
# repository at all, which is why it is here.
