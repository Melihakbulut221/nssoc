"""TTIHP26b pilot bring-up suite: the Tiny Tapeout wrapper end to end.

The device under test is hw/rtl/tt_um_melihakbulut_nssoc.v, the Tiny
Tapeout wrapper, so every stimulus in this file goes through the eight
inputs, eight outputs and eight
bidirectionals the shuttle actually gives us. Exactly three tests reach
into the hierarchy, all for the same reason -- no pin injects a
single-event upset -- and all three are marked as such. Two of them
observe only what a bench could observe. The remaining one additionally
holds one internal flop, because the two terms of STATUS.ERR_CFG are
otherwise indistinguishable from outside; its docstring says so in full.
If any other test passes here it passes on a board with an SPI master
and a logic analyser, which is the whole point of a pilot.

Coverage, in the order the tests appear:

  reset          reset values of every implemented register against
                 regmap/regmap.yaml (through sw/golden/regmap_gen.py),
                 the uio direction word, quiescent output pins, and an
                 asynchronously released reset
  serial         register read/write round trips, write-to-read-only,
                 unmapped offsets, the minimum chip-select setup of one
                 serial-clock period, and the configuration lock
  event path     EVQ_IN/EVQ_OUT over the serial port and over the
                 parallel AER pins, the show-ahead EVQ_OUT contract,
                 SYNC barrier echo, out-of-range axon drops,
                 input-queue overflow, soft reset, state clear
  inference      a small end-to-end run checked spike for spike and
                 neuron state for neuron state against sw/golden
  demonstrators  SECDED single-bit correction with a syndrome walk,
                 double-bit detection with the E10 zero substitution
                 proven by an inference, the scrub loop driven from the
                 SCRUB_STB pin, TMR masking proven by running the same
                 inference with a configuration replica corrupted, and
                 an upset in the neuron core's FSM state register
                 observed at STATUS.ERR_CFG and the ERR pin, twice: once
                 for the recovery path and once for the live term that
                 keeps the bit asserted while the core is still parked,
                 and an upset that strands the event dispatcher in
                 D_FETCH, whose bounded wait must clear BUSY on its own
                 and report the recovery (docs/16 section 5.1)
  register map   the FAULT_CLR bit assignment against regmap.yaml
  EVQ_OUT loss   output backpressure is lossless and must raise no flag,
                 a pointer upset that destroys the SYNC echo is counted
                 in CNT_EVQ_OUT_OVF and attributed away from the input
                 queue, and that counter saturates and survives both
                 CTRL.SOFT_RST and a coincident clear (section 5.1)

    Every helper below drives SER_SCK at exactly clk/4, which is host

    counting nanoseconds from wherever the test happens to be. A test
    that samples a pin mid-cycle -- `await RisingEdge(clk)` followed by a
    short `Timer` to let combinational logic settle -- leaves the clock
    offset by that Timer, and every SPI edge of the next frame inherits
    it. Measured on this design: one leftover nanosecond moves the MISO
    sampling point across a system-clock edge and the host reads the
    whole 32-bit word shifted by one bit position (0xA5A51234 came back
    as 0xD2D2891A). Awaiting one more clock edge discards the offset,
    because the clock's edges are on the grid by construction.

    That is a property of this testbench's timing, not of the design: a
    real host's SER_SCK has no phase relationship to clk at all, which is
    what the two-flop synchronizer exists for. Frames driven from

    Two independent observations separate the terms, and each one kills
    the `err_cfg_any = sticky_errcfg` mutant on its own:

      1. Timing, from the pins alone. lif_core registers err_cfg on the

         that output one edge later. In the cycle between the two, the
         ERR pin is already high while the sticky flop is still zero, so
         that cycle is driven by the live term and by nothing else.
      2. A clear the re-arm cannot undo. Holding sticky_errcfg at zero is
         what a STATUS_CLR would achieve if the re-arm did not exist.
         STATUS.ERR_CFG and the ERR pin must stay asserted through it,
         because the core is still parked and reporting a parked core as
         recovered is the failure section 7 exists to prevent.

    This is the regression test for the one failure class the pilot
    exists to rule out, found by the fault-injection campaign of docs/16
    section 5.1 and fixed in pilot_top.v section 8.

    The dispatcher requests a queue read in D_IDLE and waits for it in
    D_FETCH. `fi_rd_en` is asserted from the D_IDLE arm and nowhere
    else, so a single-bit upset that lands the FSM in D_FETCH without a
    read outstanding is waiting for a grant that will never be
    requested. Before the fix D_FETCH had exactly one exit,
    `if (fi_rd_valid)`, so that dispatcher waited forever: STATUS.BUSY
    stuck high, every further event refused, and -- measured against the
    pre-fix RTL, not assumed -- no fault flag, no counter and no fault
    pin. Five of 255 injections reached it, from two independent
    targets. The fix bounds the wait, returns to D_IDLE and latches
    `sticky_errcfg` from the combinational expiry term `fetch_expire`,
    on the same edge as the return (pilot_top.v header section 8.1;
    until 2026-08-30 the report went through a one-cycle pulse register
    that a single upset could set or clear, docs/16 section 5.8).

    The deposit below is exactly the campaign's: `dstate` = D_FETCH
    (2'b01), landing 3 ns after a clock edge, with the input queue empty
    so no read is or can be outstanding. An on-edge deposit is
    overwritten by that same edge's non-blocking update before anything
    samples it, which is why the offset is not cosmetic.

    Four host-visible results, and this test checks only those:

      1. BUSY clears by itself inside a bounded number of cycles, with
         no CTRL.SOFT_RST and no host action of any kind;
      2. STATUS.ERR_CFG is set, so the recovery is recorded instead of
         being silent -- and, the core not being parked, STATUS_CLR
         clears it, which is what distinguishes this from the latched
         live term of the test above;
      3. the ERR pin is high, so a logic analyser sees it with no
         serial frame at all;
      4. the pilot then accepts events again and reproduces sw/golden
         spike for spike and neuron for neuron.

    Like the two tests above, only the STIMULUS reaches into the
    hierarchy -- no pin injects an upset. Every observation below is one
    a bench with an SPI master and a logic analyser could make, so
    reverting the D_FETCH arm to its single-exit form fails check 1 at
    the BUSY poll rather than fails an internal-signal assertion.
