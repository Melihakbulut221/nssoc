"""TMR voter RTL vs an independent Python majority model.

hw/rtl/tmr_voter.v computes the majority as a sum of AND terms; the
reference below counts votes per bit. The two formulations are different
by construction, so agreement is evidence rather than a restatement of the
implementation (the same discipline the formal property set uses,
formal/tmr_voter_props.v).

The voter is purely combinational: no clock, no reset, one settle delay
per vector. Width comes from the elaborated parameter, so the same tests
run at every width hw/tb/Makefile.tmr elaborates (1, 8, 32); at WIDTH = 1
the input space is only eight combinations and is swept exhaustively.

Two tests exist only at some widths: the exhaustive sweep is a WIDTH = 1
test, and a pairwise three-way split needs WIDTH >= 2. cocotb fixes `skip`
when the module is imported, before there is a design handle to read WIDTH
from, so the gate reads the elaboration selector TMR_WIDTH out of the
environment - hw/tb/Makefile.tmr exports it, the same way
hw/tb/Makefile.secded exports SECDED_DUT. `width_of()` then asserts that
the elaborated parameter really is that width, so a stale or missing
TMR_WIDTH fails the run loudly instead of silently skipping (or silently
not skipping) the wrong tests.
