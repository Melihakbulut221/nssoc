"""Single-bit fault-injection campaign over hw/rtl/pilot_top.v.

This is the instrument the pilot's fault-tolerance claims rest on. The
pilot exists to show that upsets in a neuromorphic node are caught; this
suite is what turns "caught" into a number, per structure, so the next
hardening wave has a ranking to act on instead of an intuition.

The method is adapted from the sibling programme's campaign
(/home/hasanmelih/Documents/radhard-edge-ai: its docs/27, its
hw/tb/test_fi_campaign.py and the harness lessons recorded in its
docs/25 section 3). The method is inherited; none of its conclusions
are, because the two designs share no datapath -- that one is a
requantising MAC row behind an AXI port, this one is a time-multiplexed
LIF core behind an event queue.

Per injection:

  1. Hardware reset, then a full bring-up: STATE_CLR, the seven
     configuration registers, the four ECC-checked weight words, enable.
     Every register on the reset net is therefore clean at the start of
     every injection, and the three arrays that are deliberately NOT on
     the reset net (lif_core's vmem / rmem / wmem, docs/10 section 3) are
     rewritten by the bring-up. The two aer_fifo storage arrays are
     written by nothing at bring-up, so they get a sentinel fill.
  2. The fixed stimulus is pushed through the parallel AER input pins in
     three bursts (docs/10 section 7.1 event words). Pins, not the serial
     port: a serial frame is 170 clock cycles long, which would smear a
     one-cycle injection across the whole run, while a pin strobe places
     the event a known handful of cycles from a known edge.
  3. One bit of one named architectural flip-flop is XORed at a
     seeded-random cycle inside a measured busy window. The deposit lands
     3 ns after a clock edge; an on-edge deposit is overwritten by that
     same edge's non-blocking update before anything samples it. That is
     the sibling programme's recorded harness lesson, reproduced here
     rather than rediscovered.
  4. The rest of the stimulus runs, so masking has a chance to happen.
     Outputs are drained through the serial EVQ_OUT register -- the full
     16-bit event word plus VALID, not the four-bit AER_OUT_ID nibble, so
     a corrupted TYPE field cannot hide.
  5. The run is classified against sw/golden.

Everything the campaign OBSERVES is what a bench with an SPI master and a
logic analyser would observe: the serial register port and the five
status pins. Only the stimulus reaches into the hierarchy, which is the
rule test_pilot_top.py's FSM-upset test already states -- no pin injects
an upset, and a demonstrator that cannot be provoked in simulation is a
claim rather than a result.

Classification (exactly one class per injection, decided in this order):

  HANG       the run did not complete inside its cycle budget and nothing
             was flagged. Detected by a bounded poll of the BUSY pin, so
             a hang costs a timeout, never the suite.
  DETECTED   the design raised an error indication: STATUS.ERR_CFG,
             STATUS.DED_SEEN, STATUS.OVF_SEEN, or a nonzero CNT_DED /
             CNT_EVQ_OVF / CNT_AXON_OOR.
  SDC        the output differs from the golden model and nothing was
             flagged. The dangerous class.
  CORRECTED  the output matches the golden model and a correction counter
             moved (CNT_SEC, CNT_TMR): the upset happened, was masked,
             and still reached telemetry.
  MASKED     the output matches the golden model and nothing moved.

The golden model decides right from wrong, always. The design's own flags
only decide whether a wrong answer was announced -- they are never
allowed to declare an answer correct. Every record additionally carries
`out_ok`, so the share of DETECTED outcomes that also corrupted the
output is reportable rather than buried.

One consequence of that rule is worth stating before the numbers are
read. Since the memory hardening of 2026-08-26, lif_core corrects
single-bit upsets in wmem / vmem / rmem and reports them on four LEVEL
outputs (wmem_sec, wmem_ded, state_sec, state_ded). Until 2026-08-27
hw/rtl/pilot_top.v left all four UNCONNECTED, so those corrections
reached no counter and no pin and this classifier -- which reads only
what the chip reports -- had to call them MASKED rather than CORRECTED.
They are wired now and the same injections classify CORRECTED, which is
why the histogram moved without the design computing anything
differently. The rule that produced the earlier number is unchanged and
is the point: a correction the mission cannot see is a correction the
mission cannot report, and this campaign will keep saying MASKED until
it can see it. docs/16 section 4.1 carries both numbers.

The compared output is the whole observable result of the run: the
ordered stream of 16-bit event words drained from EVQ_OUT, and the final
neuron state file (V and R for every neuron) read back through
N_ADDR / N_DATA. State is part of the comparison because this is a
stateful design: an upset that leaves V wrong but produces no wrong spike
in an eight-command run has not been masked, it has been deferred.
`spikes_ok` and `state_ok` are recorded separately so the two can be told
apart in the report.

Three further per-record facts, because the five classes cannot carry
them:

  telemetry_ok  the counters and status pins read what a clean run of the
                same bring-up reads. False here with a correct output is a
                false alarm; false here with a primed counter is an erased
                record.
  latent        an architectural register still holds a corrupted value
                after the run, inheritable by the next command sequence
                even though this run was clean.
  e10_*         for double-bit weight-word injections, whether the
                degraded output is exactly the fail-operational zero
                substitution of docs/10 section 11.2 rather than garbage.

Sentinels (the sibling programme's aliasing lesson, adapted). Two things
could otherwise make a corrupted read look correct:

  * both aer_fifo storage arrays are pre-filled with 0xF0F0, an event word
    whose TYPE field is the reserved encoding 2'b11. A pointer upset that
    fetches an unwritten slot therefore yields something the dispatcher
    drops and the drain sees as a non-golden word, instead of aliasing a
    stale copy of a legitimate event;
  * the workload is chosen so the golden final V is distinct and nonzero
    for every neuron, so an upset that writes the right value to the wrong
    neuron cannot pass the state comparison.

Both are asserted, not assumed, in test_00_control.

Not every question this campaign has to answer is a rate. `test_04`
holds the DIRECTED cases: multi-step injections that place a fault and
then an upset in the structure that is supposed to catch it, at the one
cycle where the second one matters. Those cases exist because the two
bounded-wait counters report through a pulse that is high for one cycle
in a whole run, and a drawn phase finds that cycle essentially never --
so a rate over them would report robustness that was never tested. They
are logged in the same schema and counted in the same histogram, with a
`case` field naming the construction and a `script` field recording
every deposit including how many bits each one moved. Read docs/16
section 5.8 with them.

Reproducibility: one seed (CAMPAIGN_SEED) drives every randomised
injection cycle. Targets, bits and phase counts are an explicit curated
list -- no hierarchy scraping -- so the map reads directly as a hardening
priority list and the injection count is a constant rather than a
function of how the elaborator happens to name things.

    # 9. AER queue pointers, both queues. Each pointer carries one extra
    #    wrap bit, so the whole width is walked rather than sampled.
    #
    #    The target is the REPLICA STORAGE, `u_{w,r}ptr_{a,b,c}.bits`, and
    #    one deposit lands in one replica: that, and only that, is a
    #    single-event upset in a pointer. Until 2026-08-29 this group
    #    named `{u_evq_in,u_evq_out}.{wr,rd}_ptr`, which since the pointer
    #    TMR of hw/rtl/aer_fifo.v is the VOTED wire rather than storage --
    #    the same trap the configuration TMR hit on 2026-08-26 and for the
    #    same reason (item 6 above). Two things were wrong with it, not
    #    one:
    #
    #      * it is not a flip-flop, so no physical upset corresponds to
    #        the deposit; and
    #      * Icarus holds a deposit on a driven net until the driver
    #        RE-EVALUATES, and the voter's inputs stop changing as soon as
    #        the pointer stops moving, so the deposit persisted for the
    #        rest of the run. It modelled a permanent stuck-at on the
    #        voter output node, not a transient at the voter input.
    #
    #    That is why the group kept reporting its pre-TMR result -- 23 SDC
    #    and 1 HANG of 24 on 2026-08-29 [fact] -- against three replicas
    #    and a majority vote. It was a measurement of a node nothing
    #    claims to protect. Retargeted, the same 24 phases classify 72
    #    injections and the campaign pass criteria in test_04 require
    #    every one of them to be CORRECTED.
    #

    #    this one -- evq_mem, evq_hold, dispatch -- keep the phases docs/16
    #    reports. Only the pointer group's own records move.
    #
    #    Bit positions are per replica, not per pointer. Banks A and B
    #    store the pointer and its complement, so bit i of `bits` is bit i
    #    of the pointer; bank C stores an XOR mixing, so bit i of `bits`
    #    decodes to two or three wrong pointer bits (aer_fifo.v,

    #
    #     A check field is storage, and hardening pays for it in
    #     flip-flops: +32 for wchk (8 SECDED check bits per 16 weights)
    #     and +48 for smem (6 bits per neuron state word) at 8 x 8. If an

    #     error in the check field is a single-bit error in the codeword,

    #     instantiation of it.

    # 14. THE TWO BOUNDED-WAIT COUNTERS -- the safety nets themselves.
    #     Added 2026-08-30; docs/16 section 7.3 named them as the next
    #     campaign's first item and this is that item. They draw from
    #     EXT_RNG (EXT_GROUPS above) and are appended AFTER item 13, so
    #     every phase drawn by the twelve groups of the campaign of
    #     record and by the three check-field groups is untouched:
    #     measured, the first 335 records of this run are field-for-field
    #     identical to the 335 of the previous one.
    #
    #     Each net is two registers with different jobs and different
    #     exposure, so they are targeted separately rather than as one
    #     group:
    #
    #       * the WAIT COUNTER (`fetch_wait`, `oh_wait`, 6 bits each) is
    #         live only while a wait is in progress, and is re-zeroed on
    #         every successful fetch, so its corrupted values are
    #         short-lived. Sampled low / mid / high.
    #       * the TIMEOUT PULSE (`fetch_timeout`, `oh_timeout`, one bit
    #         each) WAS the report itself, and was targeted here with
    #         three phases each between 2026-08-30 and the repair later
    #         the same day. All six injections came back DETECTED on a
    #         run whose output was correct -- a fabricated configuration
    #         error, six times out of six -- and test_04 constructed the
    #         opposite direction and erased a real report. pilot_top.v
    #         header section 8.1 retired both pulses: the expiry terms
    #         are now the wires `fetch_expire` / `oh_expire`, and the
    #         same wire ends the wait and latches sticky_errcfg on one
    #         edge.
    #
    #         There is therefore nothing left here to inject INTO, and
    #         the six records are gone rather than passing. The entries
    #         stay in this list (RETIRED_TARGETS): test_01 draws their
    #         phases and skips them, so the six disappear without moving
    #         the phase of any other target, and the day a pulse
    #         register comes back the six injections come back with it,

    # 15. THE QUEUE ENTRY-PARITY CHECK FIELD. Added with the hardening of
    #     the queue storage (hw/rtl/aer_fifo.v, section "entry parity"),
    #     and for the same reason item 13 targets `wchk` and `smem`: a
    #     check field is storage, the hardening pays for it in flip-flops,
    #     and if an upset in one of those bits could corrupt an inference
    #     the protection would be importing the risk it removes. The
    #     question is asked with a deposit rather than answered with an
    #     argument.
    #
    #     The expected answer is a REPORTED FALSE DISCARD, not a
    #     corruption: the check bit is inside the codeword it protects, so
    #     an upset in it makes a good event fail its check and be dropped
    #     with par_err raised and the consumer's bounded wait expiring.
    #     One event lost and announced, which is the same outcome as the
    #     case the field exists to catch and is why it is acceptable to
    #     add unprotected state here at all.
    #
    #     `bits` is the packed per-slot vector inside the aer_par_bank
    #     instance, so the bit index IS the slot index, and the targets
    #     are the storage register rather than the checked wire -- the
    #     distinction items 9 and 11 were rewritten for. It draws from
    #     EXT_RNG and is appended last, so every phase drawn by the

    #     10), added with the protection it belongs to and for the third
    #     time on item 13's argument: a check field is storage, the
    #     hardening pays for it in flip-flops, and if an upset in one of
    #     those bits could corrupt an inference the protection would be
    #     importing the risk it removes.
    #
    #     Two bits in one pilot_chk_bank instance, so the bit index is
    #     the bit's job:
    #
    #       bit 0  dstate_par. {dstate, dstate_par} is a Hamming-distance
    #              2 code, so an upset here is an upset in the codeword
    #              and is detected exactly like an upset in dstate. The
    #              expected outcome is a REPORTED FALSE RECOVERY: the
    #              dispatcher returns to D_IDLE and latches
    #              STATUS.ERR_CFG, and because the bit takes a plain next
    #              value it is rewritten correct on that same edge, so
    #              the disagreement is one cycle wide.
    #       bit 1  evw_par. Checked only in D_ISSUE, and it takes an
    #              ENABLE rather than a next value -- the whole
    #              correctness of the evw half, see the header. An upset
    #              here between two captures makes a good event fail its
    #              check and be dropped with the drop announced, which is
    #              the same outcome as the case the field exists to catch
    #              and is why adding unprotected state here is acceptable.

    Each entry is (group, case, note, steps). The steps run inside burst
    0's busy window; `run_script` documents the step grammar.

    The pattern is the same on both ends of the pipe because the two
    nets are the same circuit twice:

      clear_midwait  an upset zeroes the counter while it is counting.
                     Does the timeout still fire, or does the wait
                     restart forever?
      fire_early     an upset drives the counter to its bound while a
                     REAL fault is being waited out. Fires early -- does
                     that cost anything?
      fire_spurious  the same, with no fault present, on a legitimate
                     one-cycle wait. This is the dangerous direction:
                     the net firing on a design that was working.
      report_kept    the CONTROL for the two cases below, and it is
                     written
                     to be exact: byte-for-byte the same steps, INCLUDING
                     the 64-cycle poll that waits for the pulse, with
                     only the final deposit removed. The poll is part of
                     the control on purpose. It reads internal state and
                     changes nothing in the design, but it does hold up
                     `run_stimulus` for 64 cycles before the drain
                     begins, and a control that skipped it would differ
                     from the case below in TWO things -- the deposit
                     and the harness timing -- which is how a first
                     version of it came out golden while the case it
                     controls came out corrupted. As written, the two
                     records differ in exactly one deposit, and any
                     difference between them is that deposit.
      report_erased  THE CASE. The fault happens, the net catches it,
                     and an upset lands on the one-cycle report in the
                     one cycle it is high. The recovery still happens.
                     Does anything tell the host it did?

    The fault is planted the same way in both nets and by a genuine
    single-bit XOR: `dstate` D_IDLE -> D_FETCH with no read outstanding
    (docs/16 section 5.1), and `oh_req` set with no read outstanding
    (section 5.7). Only the upset in the net itself is ever a `force`.

    2026-08-30, after the repair of pilot_top.v header section 8.1. The
    two cases that deposit into the report -- report_erased and
    report_fabricated -- are unchanged in every step except that the
    deposit is now a `xor?`, and the cycle they are placed at is now
    found by polling the expiry WIRE (`fetch_expire` / `oh_expire`)
    rather than the pulse register that used to follow it one cycle
    later. `wait 1` restores that cycle, so on a design that still has
    the pulse the deposit lands exactly where it landed when the defect
    was measured, and on the repaired design the script runs to the same
    place and finds nothing to deposit into. Both are recorded; test_04
    asserts which one it got. report_kept carries the same `wait 1` so
    that it stays byte-identical to report_erased but for the deposit.
    """
    # Planting the D_FETCH deadlock, and why it takes two deposits since
    # 2026-08-30.
    #
    # It used to take one: `xor dstate bit 0` from D_IDLE lands the FSM
    # in D_FETCH with no read outstanding, which is docs/16 section 5.1's
    # fault exactly. The dispatcher check field (hw/rtl/pilot_top.v
    # header section 10) closes that route. {dstate, dstate_par} is a
    # Hamming-distance-2 code, so a single flip of dstate is an illegal
    # word, `disp_chk_bad` fires COMBINATIONALLY in that same cycle, and
    # the FSM is back in D_IDLE on the next edge with STATUS.ERR_CFG
    # latched. Measured here first, as a test failure: every one of these
    # scripts logged "until fetch_expire == 1: MISSED", because the
    # 63-cycle wait never started.
    #
    # That is the hardening working, and it is worth stating what it does
    # and does not mean. The bounded wait is NOT redundant. It still
    # covers the route the check field cannot see -- a read that was
    # legitimately requested and never answered, which is where an
    # EVQ_IN pointer upset or a parity discard leaves the FSM, with
    # dstate and its check bit in perfect agreement. What has changed is
    # that the single-bit route into a SILENT 63-cycle hang is gone: it
    # is now a one-cycle recovery with a report.
    #
    # So the deadlock is planted with two deposits in the same cycle,
    # dstate and its check bit together, keeping the pair legal at
    # D_FETCH. That is two bits and therefore not a single-event upset,
    # and it is not pretending to be one -- these cases already use

    The two bounded waits are the only structures in the pilot whose
    entire job is to make a hang visible, so a random-phase rate over
    them answers the wrong question: it measures how OFTEN an upset in
    the net matters, when what is needed is whether the net still works
    WHEN it matters. The five cases per net construct that directly.

    Written 2026-08-30, this test recorded and did not judge: its one
    hard criterion was the safety property the nets actually promise --
    that the wait stays bounded -- and that held even where the report
    did not. What it measured was a real weakness in the report, and a
    criterion written around a weakness is a criterion written to pass.
