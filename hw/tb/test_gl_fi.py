"""Gate-level fault injection on the hardened submission netlist.

Every fault-injection number this project has ever quoted -- the SDC
rates in docs/16, the evidence the hardening claims rest on -- comes from
RTL-level injection into `hw/rtl/pilot_top.v`. docs/24 section 8.2 item 2
records the consequence plainly: the SEU half of the verification story
has no gate-level evidence at all. This module is that evidence, and
docs/26 is its report.

The reason it matters more here than it would elsewhere is that this
project has twice measured something at RTL that the netlist did not
support. The configuration TMR was correct in RTL and merged into one
physical bank by synthesis (docs/16 section 4). The pointer TMR measured
as useless -- 23 SDC of 24 against a working majority vote -- until the
injector was retargeted, because a deposit onto a driven net models a
permanent stuck-at rather than a transient (test_fi_campaign.py target
list item 9). Both times the RTL layer said something the layer below it
did not.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Why a deposit does not work here, and what does

docs/24 section 4.3 measured the wall. On a flattened netlist a deposit
onto a net is held until the net's DRIVER re-evaluates, and the driver is
a standard cell whose output does not change while the design holds its
state. Measured there, on this netlist: depositing `4'b0001` into
`u_pilot.u_lif.state` and clocking once leaves bit 0 still set a cycle
later, with the FSM's own reaction ORed on top. That is a stuck-at held
on a wire, not the single-cycle corruption of a storage bit that docs/16
specifies -- and it is the identical error the pointer-TMR episode is
about. Repeating it here to raise an injection count would be a
regression, not a result.

Four mechanisms were considered. The choice and the three rejections are
argued in docs/26 section 2; in short:

  * FORCE / RELEASE over exactly one clock period on the net driven by a
    mapped flip-flop's Q pin. CHOSEN. `Force` overrides the cell's own
    drive, so the corrupted value is what the fan-out cone sees; the
    force spans exactly one active clock edge, so the flip-flop samples
    its D input -- computed from the corrupted value, including through
    its own hold path -- and captures it; `Release` hands the net back to
    the cell, which now holds the captured value. That is what an upset
    in a flip-flop does: the state is wrong for one cycle, and whether it
    STAYS wrong is decided by the design's own next-state logic rather
    than by the injector. `test_00_method` proves both halves of that on
    this netlist rather than asserting them; docs/26 section 4 reports it.

  * Driving the cell model's internal state. Rejected as impossible here:
    `sg13g2_dfrbpq_1` is a UDP-based model, its state lives in the UDP
    instance's output, and neither Verilog nor VPI offers a way to write
    it. The `q` reg other libraries expose does not exist in these
    models (measured: the module body is a `$setuphold` specify block, a
    `notifier` reg and a UDP instance).

  * A modified cell model with an injection port. Rejected on
    provenance: `Makefile.gl` resolves the models out of the run's own
    `resolved.json` precisely so the models under the simulator are the
    ones that hardened the netlist. A local edit of that file would make
    every result conditional on a patch, and the patch would have to be
    trusted exactly where the whole point is not to trust an
    abstraction.

  * SDF annotation. Rejected as irrelevant to reachability: SDF changes
    delays, not the name space, so it makes no flip-flop reachable that
    is not reachable now, and Icarus does not implement the timing checks
    that would make an annotated run say anything post-route STA has not
    already said (docs/24 section 2.2).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Getting at the flip-flops at all

`SYNTH_HIERARCHY_MODE: deferred_flatten` leaves one module, but the names
survive as single escaped identifiers containing dots:
`\\u_pilot.u_lif.state[0]` is a wire in the netlist. cocotb cannot look
those up by name -- `vpi_handle_by_name` splits on `.` -- so this module
iterates the whole top-level scope once and keys the handles on `_name`.

The RTL campaign's target paths are then mapped onto those names by
`NET_MAP` below. The mapping is not cosmetic: synthesis renamed real
storage. `wmem` became `w_data_all`, `out_pend` became `lif_out_valid`,
`sticky_sec` became `sec_seen`, `u_evq_in.drop_cnt` became `fi_drop`, and
the dispatcher's `evw` is split across three names because `ev_id` and
`ev_type` are declared as slices of it. Every mapping is justified by a
line of RTL and checked at run time against the set of nets that are
actually driven by a flip-flop Q pin, which is parsed out of the netlist
file rather than assumed.

That last check is the one that stops this suite from repeating the
pointer-TMR mistake in a new form: a target that does not resolve to a
flip-flop output is not injected, it is REPORTED as unreachable with the
reason. docs/26 section 6 carries the resulting coverage statement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. The like-for-like rule

The point of this suite is comparison, so nothing about the experiment is
re-invented. `test_fi_campaign` is imported: its workload, its weight
seed, its burst structure, its golden model, its classifier and its
target list are used unchanged, and the injection phases are drawn by
replaying its own `target_list()` iteration in its own order against its
own seeded streams. A target this suite cannot reach still consumes its
draw, so every gate-level injection stands at the same (burst, delay) as
the RTL injection it is compared with.

What necessarily differs, and is recorded rather than hidden:

  * the device is the Tiny Tapeout wrapper, not `pilot_top`, because that
    is what the netlist is. The wrapper is a pin map and a reset
    synchronizer, so the stimulus is the same stimulus through
    `ui_in` / `uio_in` instead of through named ports.
  * `test_fi_campaign.fill_fifo_sentinel` has no gate-level equivalent.
    A pre-fill written by deposit would be a stuck-at; written by force
    it would evaporate on release. The two queue memories are therefore
    X until the design writes them, exactly as docs/24 section 6.2
    measured, and an injection into a slot that is still X is not a bit
    flip -- it is recorded as skipped, with the reason, and never
    classified.

# the RTL campaign of record, pinned rather than picked up
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The RTL campaign is imported rather than copied, so that its workload,
# weight seed, burst structure, golden model, classifier and target list
# are used unchanged and the comparison is like-for-like by construction.
# Importing it binds ITS cocotb tests into ITS namespace, not this one,
# so nothing extra runs -- the property test_pilot_gl relies on too.
#
# But it is imported from a COMMIT, not from the working tree, and the
# reason is not hypothetical. The first full run of this suite read
# hw/tb/test_fi_campaign.py out of the working tree while that file was
# under concurrent edit. Its directed cases acquired a step naming
# `fetch_expire` -- a register added to hw/rtl/pilot_top.v AFTER this
# netlist was hardened -- so one of the twelve constructions referred to
# storage that does not exist in the design being measured, and the
# suite crashed on it rather than reporting it. A baseline that moves
# under a comparison is not a baseline.
#
# The pin is derived, and the rule is not "the newest RTL campaign". It
# is **the newest RTL campaign that was run against the RTL this netlist
# was synthesized from**, and the difference is the whole point.
#
# A netlist is a photograph of one commit. docs/24 section 1.2 records
# that the shape-6x2 harden was pinned against e1361fe by
# hw/openlane/pin_rtl.py. While this suite was being written the RTL
# moved twice, and the second move -- "Make the fault report unerasable"
# -- retired the very flip-flops one of the disagreements in section 5 is
# about. An RTL campaign run after that describes a design that is not
# in this netlist, so comparing against it would report a difference
# between two designs as though it were a difference between two levels.
#
# So: walk the commits that touched hw/tb/fi_campaign_results.json,
# newest first, and take the first one whose hw/rtl tree is IDENTICAL to
# the netlist's pinned RTL. When the RTL moves on, this pin does not
# move with it, which is correct and is stated rather than hidden.
#
# WHICH commit the netlist came from is itself DERIVED and no longer
# written down here. The first version of this file carried the literal
# `e1361fe`, and that constant went stale the moment the design was
# re-hardened: pointing the suite at a newer run would have compared a
# new netlist against the old netlist's RTL campaign and reported the
# difference as a level effect. docs/32 section 1 is that correction.
#
# The derivation reads the run's own resolved.json, which names the
# pinned RTL snapshot hw/openlane/pin_rtl.py made for that harden by
# absolute path, hashes every file in it, and finds the commit whose
# hw/rtl tree has exactly those blobs. That is the same evidence
# docs/24 section 1.2 checked by hand, computed instead of quoted.

    # -- G. what the rails' polarity transform actually is here --------
    # Wave 6 replaced four one-bit valid flags with eight rail
    # flip-flops. The RTL builds each pair with a per-rail polarity:
    # `bits <= d ^ POL` and `q = bits ^ POL`, POL = 0 in rail A and 1 in
    # rail B. pilot_top.v's header argues that transform as an
    # attribute-independent defence -- two flops with the same (D, reset)
    # signature are one bank after opt_merge, and a polarity difference
    # gives structural hashing nothing to match.
    #
    # Whether it is still there after synthesis is a netlist question,
    # and this project has been wrong about exactly this kind of question
    # twice. So it is measured: over a full burst the two rails of a
    # healthy flag are sampled, and if rail B stores the complement they
    # DISAGREE at every sample.
    #
    # Nothing is asserted about the answer, because both answers are
    # legal designs: what matters functionally is that there are two
    # flip-flops and that the consumer compares them. What the answer
    # changes is how a flag may be READ, and flag_of() reads the checked
    # wire rather than reconstructing it for exactly this reason.
    # A netlist older than wave 6 has no rails at all -- shape-6x2, the
    # netlist docs/24 and docs/26 measure, carries each valid flag as one
    # flip-flop. That is not a failure of this check; it is a different
    # design, and `GL_TAG=shape-6x2` must keep reproducing those
    # documents. So the whole of G is conditional on the rails existing,
    # and every assertion below is written over the rails that resolved
    # rather than over a fixed list of names.

    — RTL SDC, gate level MASKED. Underneath the class labels the real
    difference is the OUTPUT: at RTL the deadlock-and-recovery returns
    `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2]` where the golden model says `[1, 2, 5, 6, 4, 2]`,
    in the control (`report_kept`) as well as in the case, and docs/16
    section 5.8 rests its ranking on that wrong answer. At gate level the
