"""Weight-SRAM ECC scrub controller suite (hw/rtl/scrub.v).

Two different things are checked here.

1. LOCKSTEP AGREEMENT with a cycle-accurate reference model. ``ScrubModel``
   below is written from the module contract -- the scrub.v header and
   docs/10 section 11.2 -- and reproduces the controller cycle for cycle:
   the five-state walk, the memory handshake, the writeback decision, the
   read-response watchdog, the window clamp and every fault counter. Every
   cycle driven through ``Harness.cycle`` compares all fourteen outputs
   against the model, so a divergence of one cycle on one bit fails the
   test that produced it. This is the docs/09 B.2 layer-1 refinement
   evidence for this block, in the same shape as
   ``hw/tb/test_lif_core_rtl.py`` for the LIF datapath.

   The model deliberately lives here rather than in ``sw/golden/``: it
   models a CONTROL path with no software-visible arithmetic and nothing
   in ``sw/`` consumes it. Promoting it to ``sw/golden/scrub.py`` with its
   own ``sw/tests`` suite is a reasonable later move; it is noted rather
   than done silently.

2. DIRECTED behaviour that random stimulus reaches slowly or not at all:
   a full clean sweep, a corrected word written back, an uncorrectable
   word NOT written back, a memory that never answers, an arbiter that
   never grants, a window shrunk under a walk in flight, counter
   saturation, FAULT_CLR coincident with a fault, the SAFE state reached
   by depositing each of the eleven illegal state encodings into the
   state register, and the ERR_CFG stickiness that keeps a parked
   scrubber visible to a host that clears its fault block.

The formal counterpart is ``formal/scrub.sby`` (property list in
``formal/scrub_props.v``). The two cover different ground: formal
quantifies over all stimulus, this file produces concrete traces --
including the SAFE-state trace, which no reset-rooted cover task can
produce because S_SAFE is unreachable from reset by design.

Fully port-driven apart from the deliberate state-register deposits in the
two encoding tests. Icarus-clean.

    ERR_CFG is the only software-visible indication that an upset has

    parked scrubber from a working one; the address is frozen, but a
    frozen address is what a starved scrubber shows too; and the
    counters and the other stickies read exactly as they did before the
    upset, because a parked controller produces no events. ERR_CFG is
    the whole signal.

    So it must survive the host acknowledging the faults it can act on.

    a schedule -- which is the documented way to use FAULT_CLR -- would
    read the block back clean with the scrubber permanently dead behind
