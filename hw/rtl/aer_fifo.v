// AER event FIFO: parameterized synchronous FIFO carrying address-event
// (AER) words between the event interfaces and the NPU pipeline
// (docs/10-npu-mvp-spec.md section 7: EVQ_IN / EVQ_OUT, 16-bit local
// event word, 64-deep by default).
//
// Contract:
//   - Registered output: an accepted read presents its data on rd_data on
//     the next clock edge, flagged by rd_valid for one cycle -- unless
//     the stored word failed its parity check, in which case the entry
//     is consumed and discarded and rd_valid stays low (section "entry
//     parity" below).
//   - Overflow-safe: a write while full is dropped (never corrupts stored
//     events or pointers) and counted in a sticky saturating drop counter,
//     surfaced at the register block as CNT_EVQ_OVF / STATUS.OVF_SEEN.
//     This is the software injection port (EVQ_IN) semantics; a link-side
//     producer gets lossless backpressure by gating wr_en with !full.
//     A write coincident with a read while full is still dropped: full is
//     evaluated before the read frees a slot (conservative, formally proven).
//   - A read while empty is refused; rd_data holds its last value.
//   - drop_clr maps to FAULT_CLR; a drop coincident with the clear
//     restarts the counter at 1 so the event is not lost (house convention).
//   - level is exact occupancy (0..DEPTH), full == (level == DEPTH),
//     empty == (level == 0); level feeds EVQ_STAT.
//   - The two pointers are triple-redundant and voted (section "pointer
//     TMR" below). ptr_mismatch reports a corrected replica disagreement
//     for one cycle; it is a level output, and the instantiating block
//     qualifies and counts it.
//   - rd_valid is dual-rail (section "the rd_valid rails" below). It is
//     DETECTED and not corrected: on a rail disagreement rd_valid reads
//     low, so the read answer is missed rather than fabricated, and
//     rv_mismatch reports it for the instantiating block to latch. In
//     the fault-free case nothing about the contract above changes.
//   - Every stored entry carries one even-parity bit (section "entry
//     parity" below). It is DETECTED and not corrected: an accepted read
//     whose stored word fails the check advances the read pointer,
//     discards the entry, holds rd_valid low and raises par_err. In the
//     fault-free case nothing about the contract above changes.
//
// The registered output is a decision, not an accident, and it is the
// one thing here that a consumer has to design around. hw/rtl/npu_regbank.v
// convention C9 requires its EVQ_OUT source to be SHOW-AHEAD
// (first-word-fall-through): valid means "a word is presented now", the
// data is that word, and both hold until the pop advances the queue.
// This module does not meet that contract and deliberately still does
// not, because the alternative is worse: a show-ahead read port needs a
// combinational read of mem[], which turns the storage into an
// asynchronous-read register file. No synchronous SRAM macro can
// implement one, so at NPU scale (docs/10 section 7.2 sizes EVQ at 64
// entries per node, and the mesh has one per node) the queue could never
// be retargeted from flip-flops to a macro. It would also invalidate the
// four proofs in formal/aer_fifo.sby, which assert the registered
// timing directly (P5: rd_valid == $past(rd_ok), and rd_data holds
// otherwise).
//
// The gap is closed on the consumer side by a one-entry show-ahead
// adapter, which costs one flop-width plus a valid bit and no bandwidth
// that any register-mapped host can notice. hw/rtl/pilot_top.v section 8
// carries the reference implementation (oh_valid / oh_data / oh_pop) and
// the full comparison of the three options that were considered.
//
// DEPTH must be a power of two, >= 2 (enforced by an elaboration guard).
// Plain Verilog-2005, Icarus-clean; the formal properties
// (formal/aer_fifo_props.v) are textually included under `ifdef FORMAL
// and are invisible to simulation and synthesis.

    // These two pointers were the highest-rate silent corruptor measured
    // anywhere in the pilot. The fault-injection campaign put 24
    // single-bit upsets into the four pointers of the two queue
    // instances and 22 ended in silent data corruption -- 21 of them in
    // the drained event stream itself, with nothing flagged: whole
    // bursts re-emitted, events duplicated, events lost, events
    // fabricated, and an unwritten slot presented as a spike. An
    // event interface has no sequence number and no length field --
    // docs/10 section 7.1 freezes the word at TYPE plus a 10-bit ID --
    // so a consumer cannot tell any of those from a real spike train.
    // Twelve flip-flops, one percent of the register count, carried 46
    // percent of the design's residual silent corruption (docs/16
    // section 5.2). That is the best protection-per-flip-flop in the
    // design, and this is the protection.
    //
    // Shape: three replicas per pointer, a bitwise majority vote, and
    // the VOTED value fed back as the next state of all three replicas.
    // Everything downstream -- level, full, empty, the mem[] index --
    // reads the voted pointer and nothing else, so a single corrupted
    // replica is masked at every output. Voted feedback also repairs the
    // corrupted replica on the next edge, so the module does not
    // accumulate upsets between events; the cost is that a replica is
    // rewritten every cycle rather than only on an increment, which is
    // switching power spent to close the accumulation window.
    //
    // The voter is written inline rather than instantiated from
    // hw/rtl/tmr_voter.v, and the expressions are that module's, verbatim.
    // The reason is file lists: this module is elaborated standalone by
    // hw/tb/Makefile (VERILOG_SOURCES is aer_fifo.v alone) and by the
    // four jobs of formal/aer_fifo.sby, so a second source file here
    // would have to be added to every one of them and aer_fifo would
    // stop being a self-contained leaf. tmr_voter is proven exhaustively
    // in formal/tmr_voter.sby; the same two expressions are re-proven
    // here in context by P7/P8 of formal/aer_fifo_props.v.
    //
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // The trap, and the construction that answers it
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Three replicas written from the same next-state expression are
    // provably equivalent, so yosys `opt_dff` normalises them into
    // identical flip-flops and `opt_merge` hashes them into one bank.
    // The design then ships one physical pointer read three times behind
    // a voter that agrees with itself. That is not hypothetical: it is
    // what happened to the configuration TMR in hw/rtl/pilot_top.v, it
    // survived review, and it was caught only by counting flip-flop
    // cells in the hardened netlist. With voted feedback the hazard is
    // acute rather than incidental -- all three replicas are loaded from
    // one shared net, which is exactly the signature opt_merge hashes on.
    //
    // The answer is the pattern pilot_cfg_bank proved out, applied to a
    // pointer:
    //
    //   keep_hierarchy   `flatten` skips the bank module and `opt_merge`
    //                    does not merge instances of user-defined modules
    //                    unless invoked with -share_all, so the three
    //                    banks are two independent steps from collapse.
    //                    Honoured by both flows this repository runs
    //                    (LibreLane/yosys and synth_ecp5); portable to no
    //                    front end that ignores yosys attributes, which
    //                    is why the second defence exists.
    //   POL + MIX        a per-replica storage TRANSFORM, plain
    //                    Verilog-2005, depending on no attribute. Each
    //                    bank stores a different FUNCTION of the pointer,
    //                    so no two banks have a flip-flop with the same
    //                    (D, reset) signature and structural hashing has
    //                    nothing to match even with the hierarchy gone.
    //                    Replica A stores the pointer true, replica B its
    //                    exact complement, replica C an XOR mixing in
    //                    which every stored bit is a function of two or
    //                    three pointer bits. See aer_ptr_bank for why the
    //                    third replica needs the mixing and cannot be had
    //                    from a polarity or a rotation.
    //
    // Neither is trusted. sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py counts the
    // flip-flops of all twelve banks in the mapped netlist of both flows,
    // and again with keep_hierarchy stripped before synthesis, and is
    // mutation-checked against a scratch copy with this construction
    // reverted. That test, not either mechanism, is what keeps this true.

    // corruption, spread over four of the eight pilot slots at bit 0 and

    //
    // What this is, in one line: one even-parity bit per entry, written
    // with the word and checked on the way out. A read whose stored word
    // fails the check consumes the entry, discards it, holds rd_valid low
    // and raises par_err. It DETECTS and does not correct, exactly as the
    // rails above do, and for the same reason -- an event dropped and
    // announced is a bounded, reported wait in both consumers, while an
    // event delivered wrong is a spike a consumer cannot tell from a real
    // one, because docs/10 section 7.1 freezes the word at TYPE plus a
    // 10-bit ID with no sequence number and no length.
    //
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Why parity and not SECDED, and why the answer changed
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // docs/16 section 6.2 item 4 costed both and ranked SECDED (22,16)
    // last in the design at 6 check bits per entry: +48 flip-flops at the
    // pilot geometry for the same 7 records, 0.15 records per flip-flop,
    // against +8 and 0.88 for parity. That was an area argument and it
    // was already decisive.
    //
    // What did NOT decide it is the queue's own timing, and an earlier
    // revision of this header said it had. docs/27's +0.3229 ns is the
    // DESIGN's worst path and it is lif_core's; the queues carry nine to
    // twelve nanoseconds of slack, which is ample for a syndrome decoder
    // costed at about 4.85 ns. A decoder here would fit.
    //
    // What decides it is area, on a path this file does not touch.
    // Measured on this design, the slow-corner slack moves with how much
    // AREA a change adds and not with how much delay it adds to the
    // changed block: this change's +27 cells cost 0.3686 ns of lif_core's
    // margin while making the queue paths faster. The SECDED codec
    // measures 117 cells and 1554.94 um2 per queue instance against
    // parity's 31 and 449.97, and carries 40 more flip-flops -- roughly
    // +4170 um2 more than this change, against +0.4306 ns of margin left
    // [fact for the codec, standalone synthesis to sg13g2].
    //
    // So this is a DEFERRAL and not a rejection, and docs/29 section 9
    // item 7 says what would settle it: one control run and one with the
    // code, on the recovered configuration. If it closes, correcting a
    // spike beats dropping it and the even-weight residual closes with
    // it.
    //
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Where the check sits, and what it costs where it sits
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // The check is combinational from the storage to the rails' D input:
    // mem/parity flip-flops -> the read multiplexer -> a WIDTH+1 input
    // XOR reduction -> one AND -> the rail flip-flops. It adds no stage
    // and no cycle, and it does not touch rd_data's own path at all.
    //
    // Measured, and it is the number that settles the shape of this
    // section: the worst setup slack of paths ending inside the two
    // queue instances is +9.2279 ns and +11.1861 ns at the derated slow
    // corner before this change, and +9.6213 ns and +12.3513 ns after it
    // [fact, docs/29 section 4.3]. The queues got FASTER. The read path
    // has nine to twelve nanoseconds of room and this check spends none
    // of the design's margin in it -- the 0.3686 ns the change does cost
    // is spent on lif_core's critical path, which this file adds no
    // logic to.
    //
    // A fallback was costed for the case where that had not been true --
    // compute the head entry's check ONE CYCLE EARLY, registering
    // `par_shadow[rd_ptr_nxt] ^ ^mem[rd_ptr_nxt]` and gating the rails
    // with the registered flag, at one more flip-flop and a bypass term
    // for the write that lands in the slot the read pointer is about to
    // reach. It is not built and should not be: it shortens a path with
    // nine nanoseconds of slack, it ADDS a cell to a design whose
    // worst-corner slack responds to area, and a cycle of lookahead is a
    // second place for the read pointer to be wrong.

    // What one parity bit does and does not claim
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Odd-weight corruption of the stored word is detected, which
    // includes every single-event upset -- the fault the campaign injects
    // and the fault this is for. Even-weight corruption is NOT detected
    // and is delivered as a valid event; two upsets in the same entry
    // between its write and its read is the uncovered case, and no single
    // check bit can cover it. The parity bit is inside the codeword, so
    // an upset in the bit ITSELF is detected too -- as a false discard of
    // a good event, which is a counted loss rather than a corruption.
    // hw/tb/test_aer_fifo.py exercises all four cases and
    // formal/aer_fifo_props.v P10..P12 prove the first, the third and the
    // exactness of the report under a single-upset fault model.
    //
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // How a discard is reported, and why not through drop_cnt
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // The obvious reuse is the sticky drop counter three lines below: the
    // queue already counts lost events and the pilot already exposes it
    // as CNT_EVQ_OVF. Two facts kill it, both readable in
    // hw/rtl/pilot_top.v.
    //
    //   It would report nothing for six of the seven records. pilot_top
    //   sinks u_evq_out's drop_cnt (`fo_drop`, declared and connected and
    //   read by nothing) on the measured grounds in its header section
    //   5.1 -- for that instance the count is backpressure cycles, not
    //   lost events. docs/16 section 6.2 puts six of the seven evq_mem
    //   SDC records in `u_evq_out.mem[1..3]`, so a discard counted there
    //   would be counted into a wire that goes nowhere.
    //
    //   It would redefine a documented register. regmap/regmap.yaml
    //   defines STATUS.OVF_SEEN as "at least one software-port event
    //   dropped at a full input queue", and P4 proves drop_cnt increments
    //   exactly on a refused write. Folding a read-side integrity discard
    //   into it makes the overflow measurement unreadable in both
    //   directions.
    //
    // So the discard is reported the way the rails' detection already is,
    // through the read answer that does not arrive: the dispatcher's
    // `fetch_expire` for EVQ_IN and the show-ahead adapter's `oh_expire`
    // for EVQ_OUT both bound the wait and latch STATUS.ERR_CFG. Those two
    // bounded waits exist, are proven and are already what makes a
    // suppressed rd_valid a DETECTED outcome rather than a hang; a parity
    // discard is the same event and takes the same path, with no edit
    // outside this file. par_err is the port for counting them separately
    // when someone wants the distinction in telemetry.
    //
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // The merge trap, in its third form
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // The pointer banks and the rails are held apart from EACH OTHER; a
    // parity bit has no twin to be merged with, so opt_merge is not the
    // hazard here. The hazard is the one hw/rtl/lif_core.v's check fields
    // carry: par_shadow[i] is a pure FUNCTION of mem[i] in every
    // reachable state, so a tool able to reason across sequential state
    // could delete the storage, rebuild the bit from the encoder and
    // leave a checker that reports every word clean -- protection that
    // passes every simulation in this repository and detects nothing in
    // silicon. Nothing in yosys does that today.
    //
    // The storage is therefore its own `keep_hierarchy` module rather
    // than a `reg [DEPTH-1:0]` here, for two reasons and only the second
    // is about the hazard. First, it is the only way the bits can be
    // COUNTED where it matters: after LibreLane's deferred_flatten, abc
    // has renumbered every cell in the flat netlist to `_NNNN_`, and an
    // instance path is the one piece of naming that survives into the
    // shipped netlist. sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py counts
    // `u_evq_in.u_par.` and `u_evq_out.u_par.` there, which is the same
    // evidence class as the pointer banks and the rails and the only one
    // this repository trusts. Second, `flatten` skips the module and no
    // optimisation pass runs after the deferred flatten, so the fold
    // above has a structural barrier in front of it as well as a test
    // behind it.
    //
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // The cost, in both currencies

    //                census, the ECP5 census and the hardening flow's
    //                own synthesis.
    //   cells/area   9686 -> 9713 cells, 152099.79 -> 154152.86 um2.
    //   slow corner  setup +0.7992 -> +0.4306 ns, zero violations at
    //                every corner. 52.08 -> 51.10 MHz against a 50 MHz
    //                target.

// pilot_flag_rail and hw/rtl/lif_core.v has lif_flag_rail. That is

// inlined its majority rather than instantiating hw/rtl/tmr_voter.v:
// this file must elaborate ALONE, because formal/aer_fifo.sby lists
// exactly aer_fifo.v and its property file, and hw/tb/Makefile builds
// the queue standalone from the same one file. A shared rail module in
// a fourth file would break both, and a queue that cannot be proven on
// its own is a worse trade than six duplicated lines.
//
// Both defences of pilot_cfg_bank, and neither trusted alone:
//
//   keep_hierarchy   `flatten` skips this module and `opt_merge` does
//                    not merge instances of user-defined modules unless
//                    invoked with -share_all.
//   POL              the per-rail storage transform, and the one that
//                    depends on no attribute. One rail stores the flag,
//                    the other its complement, so for as long as the
//                    design is RTLIL the two are a $_DFF_PN0_ and a
//                    $_DFF_PN1_ -- different D net, different reset
//                    value -- and structural hashing has nothing to
//                    match. At one bit this is not merely sufficient
//                    for two rails, it is complete: there is no third
//                    function to want.
//
// POL is measured rather than argued. With EVERY `keep` and
// `keep_hierarchy` deleted from hw/rtl, both the ASIC and the ECP5
// recipes keep all 1296 flip-flops; mutating one rail's `.POL(1'b1)` to
// `.POL(1'b0)` -- functionally identical RTL -- takes both to 1295.
// Measured 2026-08-31 [fact]; sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py
// section 1e.
//
// POL does not reach silicon, and the header of pilot_flag_rail in
// hw/rtl/pilot_top.v carries the full account. In short: the stored
// reset value is `1'b0 ^ POL`, sg13g2 offers dfflibmap no asynchronous
// flip-flop that resets to 1, so dfflibmap builds one by inverting D
// and Q around sg13g2_dfrbpq and those inverters fold against this
// module's own `d ^ POL` and `bits ^ POL`. Measured in
// hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/runs/signoff-6x2/final/nl/ [fact], per queue
// instance: u_rdv_a is 1 x sg13g2_dfrbpq_1 and u_rdv_b is
// 1 x sg13g2_dfrbpq_1 with 2 x sg13g2_buf_1, no inverter in either and
// both storing rd_valid in true polarity. It is safe -- dfflibmap runs
// after the last merge pass this flow performs -- but it means the
// shipped netlist holds no structural difference between the rails and
// the two flip-flops in it are not the evidence that POL worked. The
// attribute-stripped synthesis above is. docs/33-rail-transform.md.
//
// The port presents `bits ^ POL`, so both rails read true and a
// consumer compares them for EQUALITY. A debugger reading u_rdv_b.bits
// in an RTL simulation sees the complement of rd_valid, by design; in
// the mapped netlist there is nothing left to see.
//
// No enable port, unlike the other two copies: rd_valid is written
// every cycle, so this rail is too, and a disagreement heals on the

//                  yosys model of synthesis and NOT in the artifact that
//                  becomes silicon. Three structures in this design have

//                  was caught by counting cells; this one is counted at

//                  sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py.
//   the fold       par_shadow[i] is a pure function of mem[i] in every

//                  barrier in front of the day something does, and the

// One instance per replica, six per queue instance. The reason this is a
// module at all, rather than three reg vectors in aer_fifo, is the
// header section above: three flip-flop banks loaded from the same net
// are one bank after yosys opt_dff + opt_merge, and the voter above them
// then votes three copies of the same corrupted value.
//
// Where this module lives, and why it is not pilot_cfg_bank
// ---------------------------------------------------------
// hw/rtl/pilot_top.v already carries a bank module of this shape and the
// two are close relatives; a single shared module was the first design
// considered and was rejected on two grounds, both mechanical.
//
//   - It would have to be its own file. pilot_cfg_bank currently sits at
//     the bottom of pilot_top.v, and aer_fifo cannot include a module
//     from a file it is not compiled with. Moving it to hw/rtl/*.v means
//     editing the file list of hw/tb/Makefile, hw/tb/Makefile.pilot,
//     hw/fpga/Makefile, hw/openlane/*/config.json, scripts/
//     gen_tt_submission.py RTL_SOURCES and every .sby that elaborates
//     pilot_top -- and, critically, adding a second source file to
//     hw/tb/Makefile and formal/aer_fifo.sby, which is exactly the
//     property this leaf is required to keep: aer_fifo elaborates alone,
//     from one file, in a cocotb suite and in four formal jobs.
//   - The two banks do not want the same interface. pilot_cfg_bank takes
//     a per-bit write enable and holds otherwise, because a
//     configuration word is written field by field from a register bus.
//     A voted pointer is loaded whole, every cycle, from one expression.
//     Sharing would mean a wr_en port tied to all ones at six of the
//     nine instances and a MIX path that re-encodes a word it never
//     partially writes.
//
// So the pattern is shared and the code is not, and the two modules are
// checked by the same test for the same property. The duplication is one
// encode and one decode function; the alternative was a cross-cutting
// edit to seven file lists to save it.
//
// The two defences, neither trusted alone
// ---------------------------------------
//   keep_hierarchy   `flatten` skips this module, and `opt_merge` does
//                    not merge instances of user-defined modules unless
//                    it is invoked with -share_all. Flow-portable across
//                    the LibreLane/yosys ASIC flow and synth_ecp5, both
//                    of which use the same `flatten` pass; NOT portable
//                    to a front end that does not read yosys attributes,
//                    which is why the storage transform below exists.
//   POL + MIX        the per-replica storage TRANSFORM. Plain
//                    Verilog-2005; depends on no attribute.
//
// The transform, and why it is what it is. What opt_merge hashes is the
// stored FUNCTION -- concretely, the net driving D and the reset value --
// so the question is how many distinct functions of the loaded pointer
// the three banks present:
//
//   POL alone gives two. A storage bit has exactly two polarities, x_i
//   and ~x_i, so with three replicas one of them always collides
//   bit-for-bit with another. This is measured, not argued: the
//   configuration domain sat exactly on that bound until MIX was added
//   to it (hw/rtl/pilot_top.v header section 9).
//
//   A per-replica bit ROTATION does not help, which is worth stating
//   because it looks like it should. Structural hashing is indifferent
//   to bit position: rotating relabels which physical flip-flop holds
//   which value bit but leaves the SET of stored functions identical, so
//   the rotated bank hashes into the unrotated one flop for flop.
//
//   MIX = 1 gives a third function by making every stored bit an XOR of
//   TWO OR THREE distinct pointer bits. Nothing of that form can equal
//   x_i or ~x_i for any i, so replica C is provably non-collidable
//   against A and B rather than measured to be. The map is two
//   unit-triangular XOR layers over GF(2): layer 1 makes every bit the
//   XOR of itself and its upper neighbour, and layer 2 folds the layer-1
//   bit 0 into the top bit, which is the bit layer 1 leaves at weight
//   one. Invertible by construction (a product of two unit-triangular
//   matrices) and its inverse is the same two layers run backwards. One
//   XOR per bit forward; the reverse is an XOR chain of length W-1,
//   which is this defence's timing cost and the reason MIX is paid for
//   on one replica of three rather than two.
//
// The honest limit, stated where it applies. Every row of the MIX map
// has weight >= 2 only for W >= 3. At W = 2 -- an EVQ_*_DEPTH of 2,
// which hw/tb/Makefile.pilot exercises as the q2x2 build -- no 2x2
// invertible GF(2) matrix has both rows of weight 2, so one of replica
// C's two bits necessarily reduces to a single pointer bit and can be
// hashed into replica A or B once keep_hierarchy is gone. That is a
// property of the width, not of this map: at W = 2 the attribute-free
// layer holds five of six flip-flops per pointer and no encoding can do
// better. The pilot's own build is DEPTH = 4 (W = 3) and the default is
// DEPTH = 64 (W = 7), both fully covered.
//
// The map is invertible by construction, and the construction is
// checked rather than asserted: hw/tb/test_aer_fifo.py is run at DEPTH
// 2, 4, 8 and 64, which is W = 2, 3, 4 and 7, and every one of its
// fifteen tests reads the queue through q. A non-invertible map would
// not survive the first fill and drain.
//
// A single upset in replica C decodes to two or three wrong bits at q.
// That is free against a single fault: they are all in ONE replica, and
// a bitwise majority masks every bit on which one replica disagrees,
// however many. What it costs is a double fault: two upsets in different
// replicas are uncorrectable only if they land on the same bit of the
// voted word, and widening replica C's error from one bit to two or
// three raises that coincidence for a (C, A) or (C, B) pair by about the
// same factor [estimate on the factor; the widening itself is fact]. It
// buys the third replica existing at all, which is a first-order effect
// traded against a second-order one.
//
// `keep` on `bits` is a third, weakest layer: measured on the
// configuration domain it does NOT stop the merge on its own -- it
// preserves the wire name while the storage still disappears -- so it is
// here only to stop opt_clean, never as evidence that the bank survived.
// The evidence is the flip-flop count in
// sw/tests/test_synthesis_guards.py.
//
// The stored image is `enc(d) ^ POL` and the port presents
// `dec(bits ^ POL)`, so every user of q sees the true pointer and only
// the physical cells differ. A debugger reading u_wptr_b.bits sees the
// complement of the write pointer and u_wptr_c.bits sees its mixed
// image, both by design; hw/tb/test_aer_fifo.py drives the replicas
// through this port rather than by writing bits directly, except in the
// injection tests, which deliberately corrupt the raw image.
