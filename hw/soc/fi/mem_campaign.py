"""The memory fault-injection campaign of docs/67: draw by REGION of the
program's own link map, run, classify -- on the hardened SoC and on the
same SoC with the memory codec off.

    hw/soc/fi/mem_campaign.py --build hw/soc/out/s67-fi-h1 \
        [--counterfactual hw/soc/out/s67-fi-h0] [--draws 40] [--jobs 18]

`hw/soc/flow/fi_core.sh` builds and elaborates once per configuration
(SOC_MEM_HARDEN=1, the design; SOC_MEM_HARDEN=0, the counterfactual;
SOC_SCRUB_IVL=0, the design with the scrubber walking every second idle
cycle). This drives `vvp` on those images with +mem/+midx/+mbit/+cycle
and classifies what comes back, from the RECORD lines
hw/soc/tb/tb_soc_fi.v prints and from nothing in the RTL.

WHY THE STRATA ARE REGIONS AND NOT MEMORIES

docs/41 section 3.1's criterion -- persistence times silence -- gives
four different answers for four kinds of word in the same 72 KiB, and a
uniform rate over the whole would describe none of them:

    ROM.text     an instruction. Never rewritten (nothing writes the
                 ROM), executed repeatedly, so an upset is persistent and
                 shows as a wrong instruction: a trap if it decodes as
                 illegal, a silently wrong answer if it does not.
    ROM.rodata   a constant the program reads. Persistent; silent.
    RAM.data     .data and .bss: the program's variables, including the
                 four words it publishes its answer in. Rewritten by the
                 program at its own cadence, which for a loop counter is
                 every iteration and for a result word once.
    RAM.stack    the live stack. Rewritten on every call; an upset in a
                 saved register or a return address survives exactly
                 until the frame is popped.
    RAM.pmpbuf   the PMP test buffer: written once, read to check.
    RAM.unused   a word the program never touches. An upset there has no
                 consequence at all, and the check bits stored beside it
                 are what the scrubber spends its walk on.
    ROM.unused   the ROM rows above the image. Fetched by nothing.
    RAM.chk      a CHECK bit of a used RAM row (the hardened build only):
    ROM.chk      state the codec ADDED, which an upset can hit exactly as
                 it can hit the data -- docs/58's mtime_chk argument.

The region boundaries are read from the ELF the build linked, not
written down, so a change to the workload moves the strata with it.

WHAT DECIDES RIGHT FROM WRONG. The golden run, always -- an undeposited
run of the same image, recorded once and re-recorded to prove it
reproduces -- exactly as hw/soc/fi/campaign.py does for the core. The
classes are docs/16 section 1.6's five, one per injection, in its
order; CORRECTED means the answer matched golden AND one of the SCRUB
block's counters moved, which is the only thing in this design that can
make the class reachable for a memory upset.

THE COUNTERFACTUAL IS THE SAME DRAWS ON THE UNHARDENED BUILD. The seed
is derived per (stratum, index), so the (region, word, bit, cycle) of
draw k is the same in both builds -- except the check-bit strata, which
the unhardened build does not have. docs/58 section 8.4's calibration is
the rule: the strata the codec does not touch have to come back
identical between the two builds, or the delta is a difference of two
things.

WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN DOES NOT COVER

  * RTL, single-bit, storage only: no transient in the codec's own
    gates, no multi-bit strike, no gate-level netlist. The uncorrectable
    class is reached only by the directed tests in test_soc_mem.py.
  * One workload (docs/42's dense kernel), one seed, one draw count.
    Every number is conditional on an upset having landed in the
    measured window. docs/16 section 7.5.
  * The scrub interval at which the design ships is measured in ONE
    build and the every-idle-cycle setting in another; nothing between
    them is.
  * The counters are read hierarchically, not over the bus.
