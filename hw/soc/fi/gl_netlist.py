"""The mapped netlist's flip-flops, parsed once, for the gate-level core
campaign of docs/74.

    hw/soc/fi/gl_netlist.py <netlist.v> --census
    hw/soc/fi/gl_netlist.py <netlist.v> --emit <fi_gl_sites.vh>
    hw/soc/fi/gl_netlist.py <netlist.v> --list  <flops.tsv>

WHAT THIS IS

docs/42's campaign injects into the RTL by hierarchical name, through a
case statement hw/soc/fi/targets.py generates. The netlist has no
hierarchy: LibreLane's final `soc_top.nl.v` is one flattened module in
which every sequential element is an `sg13g2_dfrbpq_*` cell with an
anonymous instance name (`_77486_`) and a Q net that carries whatever
name yosys let survive -- an RTL name when one did, a consumer's name
when opt_clean preferred that alias (docs/32 section 4.2), `_NNNN_` when
none did. So the gate-level site list is NOT a list a person writes: it
is every sequential cell in the file, in file order, and this module is
the only thing that reads the file.

Three things come out of one parse, and the campaign checks the first
against the elaborated design before it injects anything:

  * a numbered list of every flip-flop -- index, cell, instance, Q net;
  * the Verilog the gate-level bench includes: a concatenation of every
    Q net (so a run can dump the whole flop state per cycle and so the
    bench can read any flop by index), and a force/release case over
    every flop (so the bench can upset any flop by index);
  * a census against docs/42's RTL site table: which RTL bits have a
    netlist flip-flop of the same name, which do not, and which netlist
    flip-flops under `u_ibex.` carry no RTL site's name at all.

The census by NAME is deliberately only the first word on the mapping.
docs/32 section 4.2 found four rails whose flip-flops carried the
consumer's name and one whose name moved between hardens; here the
IF/ID instruction register turns up as the register file's read-address
port. The mapping the campaign injects through is the one
hw/soc/fi/gl_map.py derives from a per-cycle trace of both designs on
the clean run, and this file's name census is what that derivation is
checked against.

# the general replica census: three instruments over one structure
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# docs/75. `wdog_replicas` above is this, specialised to one structure
# and one width, and it is kept because docs/74 quotes it. Everything
# that counts replicas now goes through `tmr_census`, including
# sw/tests/test_soc_synthesis_guards.py, so that there is ONE cone
# implementation in the tree and not one per caller --
# `test_the_verdict_rule_is_one_file_and_not_two_copies_of_one` is the
# same rule applied to the STA verdict.
#
# THREE INSTRUMENTS, because they do not agree and the disagreement is
# the point:
#
#   by_q_net    the flip-flops whose Q net is called `<bank>.bits`.
#               This is what gl_netlist.py --census does against the
#               RTL site table and what docs/74 section 6.6 reports as
#               29 / 14 / 15. It UNDERCOUNTS a mixed replica in a
#               netlist that has been through dfflibmap: the flop that
#               stores an inverted bit is a different cell from the one
#               that carried the name, and it carries none.
#
#   by_instance the flip-flops whose INSTANCE PATH lies under the bank.
#               This is what every guard in sw/tests has always used.
#               It is exact wherever the instance path survives -- a
#               yosys `flatten` prefixes `$flatten\<path>.` onto every
#               cell it lifts, including cells dfflibmap created inside
#               the module -- and it is BLIND wherever the path does
#               not survive, which is the netlist LibreLane writes.
#
#   cone        the flip-flops in the fan-in cone of the net the voter
#               reads. It depends on no name at all and is the only one
#               of the three that works on the shipped netlist.
#
# The cone is the measurement; the other two are reported beside it so
# that a disagreement is visible rather than inferred.

# Each entry is (prefix, bank instances, the wires the bank drives, the
# voter instance). The VOTER is named because the cone must start at the
# voter's own input pin and not at the bank's output wire wherever both
# survive: those two nets are the same net in a correct design and are
# NOT the same net in a design whose voter reads one replica twice,
# which is a failure no flip-flop count can see

    assumed -- a census that silently fell back to the bank's own
    storage net would count replica A correctly and tell a reader
    nothing about it.
