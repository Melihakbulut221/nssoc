"""The strata and the injection sites of the core fault-injection
campaign, written down ONCE.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN TWO LISTS

The campaign needs the same target list in two languages: Verilog, where
a hierarchical name has to be written literally because Icarus cannot be
handed one as a string, and Python, where the classifier has to know
which stratum a record belongs to.  Two copies of that list is one
copy too many.  If the Verilog thought site 17 was `mtvec` and the
Python thought it was `mcause`, every number in the campaign would be
attributed to the wrong structure and nothing would look wrong.

So this module is the list, `emit_vh()` generates the Verilog from it,
and the testbench dumps what it actually elaborated -- name, path and
`$bits` width per site -- which `campaign.py` compares against this
table before it injects anything.  A path that moved, a width that
changed and an index that slipped are all caught by that comparison
rather than by a reader.

THE STRATA, AND WHY THEY ARE THESE

`docs/16-fault-injection-campaign.md` section 6 ranks per structure
because an unstratified campaign spends its budget where the flip-flops
are.  In this core that is overwhelming: the architectural register file
is 992 of the 2,198 injectable RTL bits, so a uniform random campaign
would put nearly one injection in two into `x1`..`x31` and would give
the main control FSM -- fifteen bits -- an expected 0.7 injections in a
hundred.

The strata below are therefore drawn over the ARCHITECTURE -- the
structures the RISC-V privileged specification and the Ibex user manual
name -- and the campaign samples an equal number from each.  A stratum
is a thing one can make a decision about.  "The PMP configuration
registers" is a stratum because docs/09's software architecture rests on
them; "everything with `_q` in its name" is not.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE

  * `ibex_top`'s scrambling key registers, the icache, the dummy
    instruction LFSR, the CHERIoT half, the lockstep wrapper and the
    debug trigger registers.  None of them exists at this
    configuration's parameters -- ICache 0, SecureIbex 0, DbgTriggerEn 0,
    BaseIsa RV32I -- so there is nothing to inject into.  The testbench
    dump is what proves that rather than this comment: a site that did
    not elaborate is a hard error there.
  * The writeback stage.  `WritebackStage = 0` selects `g_bypass_wb`,
    which has no flip-flops at all; writeback is combinational in this
    configuration.  docs/42 section 4.3 records that as a fact about the
    configuration rather than a gap in the campaign.
  * The memories, the fabric and the peripherals.  This campaign is
    about the CORE, because docs/38 section 10 item 4 is a decision
    about the core.  docs/42 section 9 says what that leaves uncovered.
