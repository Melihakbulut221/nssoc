"""The strata and the injection sites of the NPU-connection campaign of
docs/52, written down ONCE.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN TWO LISTS

The same reason hw/soc/fi/targets.py exists, and the same failure it
prevents: the campaign needs the target list in Verilog, where a
hierarchical name must be written literally, and in Python, where the
classifier has to know which stratum a record belongs to.  Two copies of
that list is one copy too many.  `emit_vh()` generates the Verilog, the
testbench dumps what it ELABORATED -- index, stratum, name, `$bits` and
full path -- and `npu_campaign.py` control 1 compares all five against
this table before it injects anything.

THREE POPULATIONS, AND THEY ARE NOT EQUIVALENT

docs/51 section 14 item 1 records what is unprotected in this block, and
the list is not homogeneous.  An upset in the serial transport corrupts
ONE REGISTER ACCESS.  An upset in the event path corrupts AN INFERENCE.
An upset in the cause register corrupts WHAT THE OPERATOR IS TOLD.  Those
are three different consequences and they lead to three different
decisions, so they are three different populations and the campaign
samples each of them equally rather than sampling the block uniformly
and reporting an average that describes none of them.

docs/42 section 4.1 makes the same argument for the core, and docs/41
section 3.1 makes the criterion explicit: rank by PERSISTENCE TIMES
SILENCE, not by how important the register sounds.  The strata below are
drawn so that a stratum is a thing about which one could make a
different hardening decision.

AND ONE OF THEM IS INSIDE THE FROZEN DIE

`hw/rtl/pilot_top.v` is INSTANTIATED in this design, not copied
(docs/51 section 3), so its flip-flops are reachable from this testbench.
Injecting into them is legitimate as MEASUREMENT -- docs/16 already did,
on the block alone -- but the records must be separable, because they
lead to different decisions:

  * an upset in the connection is a property of a design that is STILL
    OPEN.  It can be hardened.
  * an upset in the die is a property of SILICON ALREADY COMMITTED.
    docs/34 pins the submission by blob hash and the TTIHP26b shuttle
    closes 2026-09-21.  Nothing this campaign finds there can be fixed
    in that die.

So `die_ser` is a stratum of its own and every report prints it apart
from the rest.  It is deliberately NOT a re-measurement of the die:
docs/16 did that, on the whole block, with 255 injections and its own
target list.  What this stratum is, is the die's OWN HALF OF THE SERIAL
TRANSPORT -- the synchronizers and the 40-bit shift engine that
`soc_npu_ser.v` talks to -- so that the same 40-bit frame, implemented
twice on the two sides of one pin boundary, is measured with the same
draws.  Nothing else in the die is a target here and docs/52 section 9
says what that leaves uncovered.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE

  * The CORE, the fabric, the memories, the CLINT, the timers, the UART
    and the watchdog's own state.  docs/42 is the core's campaign and
    docs/41 section 8 is the watchdog's.  This one is about the block
    between them, which is the block docs/51 section 18 says is the
    first in the SoC to sit between two measured things and be itself
    unmeasured.
  * The rest of `pilot_top`: its LIF datapath, its weight memory, its
    configuration bank, its own event queues and its scrubber.  docs/16
    measures all of them and docs/32 confirms the RTL result against the
    netlist.
