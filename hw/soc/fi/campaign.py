"""The core fault-injection campaign of docs/42: draw, run, classify.

    hw/soc/fi/campaign.py --build hw/soc/out/fi-core [--draws 100] [--jobs 18]

`hw/soc/flow/fi_core.sh` builds and elaborates once; this drives `vvp`
on the result, one process per injection, and classifies what comes
back.  It decides nothing from the RTL: every input to a class is a
field of the RECORD line `hw/soc/tb/tb_soc_fi.v` prints, and every one
of those is a pin, a console character or a word the program itself
published.

WHAT DECIDES RIGHT FROM WRONG

The golden run, always -- an undeposited run of the same program on the
same design, recorded once at the start and re-recorded to prove it
reproduces.  `docs/42` section 3 argues why that and not an ISA
simulator, and says what it does and does not license.

The program's own self-checks are a DETECTION channel and never an
oracle.  A run whose `fail_mask` is zero has not been declared correct
by this campaign; it has been declared unnoticed by the program, which
is a different and much weaker statement.  That is the same separation
`docs/16` section 1.6 draws with `out_ok`.

THE CLASSES

`docs/16` section 1.6's five, in its order, exactly one per injection:

    HANG       the run did not complete inside its budget and nothing
               announced anything
    DETECTED   something announced: the watchdog escalated, the program
               reported a failed self-check, the core took a trap the
               golden run does not take, or an Ibex alert pin fired
    SDC        the result differs from golden and nothing announced
    CORRECTED  the result matches golden and a correction mechanism
               moved
    MASKED     the result matches golden and nothing moved

CORRECTED is structurally unreachable in this design and that is a
finding rather than an omission: `small-pmp` has no correction
mechanism inside the core at all -- no lockstep, no register-file ECC,
no voter -- so there is nothing that could move.  docs/42 section 5
says so in the table rather than quietly dropping the column.

THE PAIR IS THE MEASUREMENT

Every injection is run TWICE: once with the watchdog armed and once
with `wdog_dis_i` held high, which is soc_wdog.v W1's bootstrap pin and
the only thing in the design that can stop the block.  The disarmed run
is the same machine with the same upset and no backstop, so it is what
says whether a machine the watchdog reset was in fact dead.

Without it, "the watchdog escalated" is not a catch rate.  It cannot
distinguish a backstop that saved a hung core from one that reset a
core that was about to finish correctly, and those lead to opposite
decisions.  docs/41 section 8.3 makes the same argument with its
unhardened counterfactual.

AND A CATCH IS A PORT EVENT, NEVER A TIMEOUT

`wdog_first` is the cycle of a transition on `nmi_o`, `wdog_rst_o` or
`wdog_no`.  A run that ends because the simulation budget expired has
no such transition and can never be counted as caught.  The budget is
additionally checked to be long enough for four complete escalation
ladders after the LAST cycle any injection can be drawn at, so "the
watchdog did not fire" means it had four chances and took none of
them -- not that the simulation stopped first.
