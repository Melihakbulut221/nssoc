// Core-local interruptor: the RISC-V machine timer and the machine
// software interrupt.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR, and why it is not the same thing as the GPTIMER two
// slots away on the peripheral bus. That question is argued in
// docs/40-interrupts-timers-watchdog.md section 4; the short form is the
// division of labour this file implements and the GPTIMER's header
// mirrors:
//
//   CLINT owns TIME. mtime is a free-running 64-bit up-counter that is
//   never reloaded and never restarted, and mtimecmp is a deadline on
//   it. That is the only time base with an architectural meaning: the
//   RISC-V privileged specification names mtime, every RV32 operating
//   system's clocksource reads it, and a core without one has no
//   portable notion of elapsed time. It drives irq_timer_i and NOTHING
//   ELSE drives irq_timer_i.
//
//   GPTIMER owns INTERVALS. Its timers count DOWN from a reload value
//   and restart, which is what periodic work and timeouts want, and its
//   last timer is the watchdog. It is a peripheral, on the peripheral
//   bus, with GRLIB's register map.
//
// Up-counting monotonic time and down-counting reloadable intervals are
// different jobs with different register shapes, and neither is a
// convenient way to do the other's. That is the whole answer to "are
// these two blocks duplication".
//
// =====================================================================
// REGISTER MAP
// =====================================================================
//
// The standard CLINT layout, which is what NOELVSYS places at
// 0xE0000000 (docs/08-gr801-datasheet-notes.md section 2.2) and what
// every RISC-V platform uses. Offsets are within the region.
//
//   0x0000  MSIP       bit 0 only. Writing 1 raises irq_software_o.
//   0x4000  MTIMECMPL  low  32 bits of the 64-bit deadline
//   0x4004  MTIMECMPH  high 32 bits
//   0xBFF8  MTIMEL     low  32 bits of the 64-bit counter
//   0xBFFC  MTIMEH     high 32 bits
//
// mtip_o is a LEVEL: mtime >= mtimecmp, unsigned, 64 bits wide, compared
// combinationally every cycle. It is not a pulse and it is not latched.
// The only way software clears it is by moving mtimecmp above mtime,
// which is the RISC-V privileged specification's own statement of how
// the machine timer works and is why there is no "acknowledge" register
// here to get wrong.
//
// MSIP AND MTIMECMP RESET TO ZERO, WHICH MEANS MTIP IS HIGH AT RESET.
// mtimecmp = 0 and mtime = 0 satisfies mtime >= mtimecmp. That is
// correct and standard -- the RISC-V specification gives mtimecmp no
// reset value, and a platform that reset it to zero has a pending timer
// interrupt from cycle zero. It is harmless because mie.MTIE resets to
// zero, so nothing is taken until software enables it, but a driver that
// enables MTIE before programming mtimecmp will take an immediate
// interrupt. Recorded here rather than hidden behind a non-standard
// reset value, and hw/soc/tb/cocotb/test_soc_clint.py asserts it.
//
// =====================================================================
// THE 64-BIT-REGISTER-ON-A-32-BIT-BUS HAZARD, NOT SOLVED HERE
// =====================================================================
//
// mtimecmp is 64 bits and the bus is 32. Writing it in two stores passes
// through an intermediate value that is neither the old deadline nor the
// new one, and if that intermediate is <= mtime a spurious timer
// interrupt appears between the two stores.
//
// This block does NOT paper over that with a shadow register, because
// doing so would change the programming model that every RISC-V timer
// driver already implements. The architectural sequence is the one in
// the RISC-V privileged specification's own commentary:
//
//     sw   all_ones, MTIMECMPL   ; no deadline can be met
//     sw   new_hi,   MTIMECMPH
//     sw   new_lo,   MTIMECMPL
//
// The same hazard exists on a 64-bit READ of mtime, and the standard
// answer is the same: read high, read low, read high again, and repeat
// if the two highs differ. hw/soc/tb/sw/test_ibex.c uses both sequences
// and hw/soc/tb/cocotb/test_soc_clint.py demonstrates the hazard is real
// by driving the naive sequence and observing the spurious interrupt.
//
// =====================================================================
// WHAT IS NOT HERE
// =====================================================================
//
//   * More than one hart. MSIP is one bit at offset 0 and MTIMECMP one
//     pair at 0x4000. A multi-hart CLINT indexes both by hart ID; there
//     is one hart, so there is one of each, and every other offset in
//     the 64 KiB window is unimplemented.
//   * An independent time base. mtime here is driven from the system
//     clock divided by TICK_DIV. A real part wants mtime on an
//     always-on oscillator that survives the system clock being gated or
//     stopped, which is a clocking and power-intent question this SoC
//     has not reached. Consequence: with TICK_DIV = 1 the mtime tick and
//     the CPU cycle are the same event, so mtime cannot be used to
//     measure anything the clock itself is doing wrong.
//   * Protection for mtimecmp, msip, or the response registers. Section
//     H6 below is the argument, and it is an argument and not an
//     omission.
//
// UNIMPLEMENTED OFFSETS ARE A BUS ERROR, not a read of zero. This is the
// same choice soc_top.v makes for an unoccupied peripheral slot and the
// same choice soc_bus.v makes for an unmapped address, and it is made
// for the same reason: a register that reads zero looks like a register
// that works. It does diverge from a multi-hart-aware driver's
// expectation that probing hart 1's MSIP returns something rather than
// faulting -- there is no hart 1 in this SoC, and saying so loudly is
// the point.
//
// =====================================================================
// H6: MTIME IS A CODEWORD, AND THE CODE CORRECTS IT EVERY TICK
// =====================================================================
//
// docs/41 section 7.4 ranked mtime above everything the watchdog wave
// left unprotected and then declined to protect it, on cost:
//
//     mtime is monotonic and free-running and never reloads, so an
//     upset displaces it FOR EVER ... a single-bit flip in a high bit
//     jumps the architectural clock by up to 2^63 ticks, and every
//     deadline software computes as mtime + delta is then wrong
//
// and priced the obvious answer -- triple mtime and mtimecmp -- at 256
// added flip-flops and roughly +27,000 um2, about a tenth of the Ibex
// core. docs/43 section 12 and docs/44 section 3 deferred it twice more,
// each time for a stated reason. This is the answer, and it is not TMR.
//
// WHAT THE STRUCTURE BUYS. TMR is what you use when the next value of a
// register is unrelated to its current one, because then the only way to
// know the stored value is wrong is to store it again somewhere else.
// mtime is not that register: its next value is its current value plus
// one, and a code over it is therefore CHECKABLE and REPAIRABLE without
// a second copy of the data. Concretely:
//
//   mtime is held as the 64-bit data field of a (72,64) SECDED codeword
//   whose 8 check bits are the only added state. Every tick the stored
//   codeword is DECODED, the corrected 64-bit value is what ticks, what
//   the comparator sees and what a bus read returns, and the check bits
//   are RE-ENCODED over the value that goes back in.
//
// Three consequences, and the third is the one that makes this cheap:
//
//   1. A single-bit upset anywhere in the 72 bits -- data or check -- is
//      CORRECTED, not merely detected, and it is corrected before it
//      reaches any port. mtip never asserts early, a bus read never
//      returns the corrupt word, and the counter goes on from the right
//      value. That is the same guarantee TMR gives, on 8 added
//      flip-flops instead of 128.
//   2. A double-bit upset is DETECTED and never miscorrected, because
//      every column of the H matrix in secded_enc.v has odd weight. The
//      block cannot repair it -- the information is gone -- and it says
//      so on mt_ecc_o.
//   3. THE COUNTER SCRUBS ITSELF. A code over a register that is written
//      once a mission needs a scrubber, because errors accumulate until
//      something rewrites the word; docs/43 built one for the register
//      file and docs/43 section 6.4 left its period unbounded. mtime is
//      rewritten EVERY CLOCK by construction, so the scrub period here
//      is one cycle and there is no scrubber to build, no period to
//      choose and no accumulation to bound. The window in which a second
//      upset could turn a correctable word into an uncorrectable one is
//      20 ns wide.
//
// WHY NOT A RESIDUE CHECK, which docs/41 section 7.4 pointed at. A
// residue mod k maintained beside the counter -- r <= r + 1 mod k, and
// check mtime mod k == r -- is cheaper still: mod 3 is TWO flip-flops.
// It detects every single-bit flip, and that is not a small claim: a
// flip at bit i changes the value by +/- 2^i, and 2 is invertible modulo
// any ODD k, so 2^i is never 0 mod k and the residue always moves. All
// 64 bits, not most of them. (The trap is an EVEN modulus: mod 2^a the
// residue is the low a bits and is blind to bits a..63 -- 62 of the 64
// bits at mod 4. An even modulus is a check that covers the harmless end
// of the counter and none of the dangerous one.)
//
// But it only DETECTS. The residue says the clock is wrong; it does not
// say by how much, so there is nothing to subtract. Making a residue
// CORRECT means making the syndrome name the bit -- an arithmetic AN
// code with the 128 values +/- 2^i all distinct mod k, which needs k
// > 128 and so 8 check flip-flops, the SAME storage as this SECDED, plus
// a 128-way syndrome decode that the Hamming code gets for free from its
// column structure. So the residue is not a cheaper corrector; it is
// only a cheaper detector, and docs/38 section 8.5's argument against
// lockstep applies here in reverse: a detector whose only recovery is
// "software is told its clock is wrong" is worth less than a corrector
// that costs six more flip-flops. It is priced in docs/58 section 4.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT PROTECTED, and these are decisions:
//
//   * mtimecmp, 64 flip-flops. It fails the docs/41 section 3.1
//     criterion on BOTH halves. It is not persistent -- software
//     rewrites it at every deadline, so an upset survives one interval
//     and not the mission -- and it is not silent: an upset DOWNWARD
//     satisfies mtime >= mtimecmp at once, the handler runs early and
//     rewrites the deadline, and an upset UPWARD moves the deadline out
//     of reach so the timer interrupt stops, which is a missed deadline,
//     which is the exact failure the watchdog is the backstop for.
//     mtime's upset is the one that keeps the interrupts coming and
//     makes them all wrong. That is the asymmetry, and it is why the
//     code is over the counter and not over the comparand.
//   * msip, 1 flip-flop. One bit cannot be tripled -- the replication
//     bound in soc_tmr_bank.v's header -- and there is nothing in this
//     module to bundle it with that shares its reset domain and its
//     write policy. Its upset raises or drops a software interrupt that
//     software itself sets and clears, and it is visible in the register
//     it lives in.
//   * rdata_o, rvalid_o, err_o -- 34 flip-flops of bus response. They
//     are overwritten every cycle from the request, which is docs/41
//     section 3.1's "a register the block itself overwrites every tick
//     sheds an upset on its own".
//   * tick_cnt. At TICK_DIV = 1 it is dead logic and the optimiser
//     removes it: the block's 163 flip-flops are 64 + 64 + 1 + 32 + 1 +
//     1 and there are none of it left to protect.
//
// WHAT THE REPORT IS, and what it conflates. mt_ecc_o is one cycle high
// whenever the stored codeword was not a codeword, corrected or not. It
// goes to BUSSTAT (docs/44), which is the only telemetry destination in
// this SoC: there is NO free offset in a standard CLINT window to put a
// status register at -- 0x0000..0x3FFF is the msip array, 0x4000..0xBFF7
// the mtimecmp array and 0xBFF8..0xBFFF mtime, so every offset this
// block faults on is architecturally spoken for by a hart that does not
// exist. Conflating a correction with an uncorrectable is the mistake
// soc_busstat.v's own header criticises pilot_top.v for making, and it
// is made here knowingly: BUSSTAT's STATUS register has exactly one bit
// left below the interrupt bit that its header forbids moving, and the
// class the conflation hides -- an uncorrectable -- needs two upsets
// inside one 20 ns tick in one 72-bit word, which is outside the
// single-upset fault model every campaign in this repository uses.
// docs/58 section 9 prices the separation at 18 more flip-flops.
