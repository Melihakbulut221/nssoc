// SoC top level: Ibex, the system fabric, the memories, the peripheral
// bridge and the two device tables.
//
// This is the first thing in this project that is a system rather than a
// block. What it is and is not:
//
//   IS   the memory map of regmap/memmap.yaml, decoded by soc_bus.v,
//        with the four implemented regions behind real slaves and
//        everything else answered by the error slave.
//   IS   a working boot path: the core resets into the ROM at the
//        address the map derives, fetches from one slave, reads and
//        writes data in another, and reaches its peripherals through an
//        APB bridge.
//   IS PARTLY hardened, and the list is worth being exact about because
//        this line said "IS NOT hardened. No ECC, no scrubbing, no TMR,
//        no bus error latch ... the BUSSTAT and SCRUB slots in the map
//        are reserved and empty" until docs/55, by which time four
//        documents had made most of it false. What is protected today:
//        the architectural register file carries a SECDED codec and a
//        scrub (docs/43); the watchdog's persistent state is a
//        triple-redundant word (docs/41); BUSSTAT is implemented and
//        counts what those two mechanisms absorb (docs/44); and the NPU
//        connection carries bounded waits on its transport and its
//        register window plus a triple-redundant control and cause bank
//        (docs/55); the time base is a SECDED codeword (docs/58); and
//        as of docs/67 EVERY ROW OF THE RAM AND THE BOOT ROM carries a
//        SECDED check field, is corrected on read, answers an
//        uncorrectable word with a bus error, and is walked by a
//        scrubber -- soc_mem_ecc.v, under both soc_mem.v and
//        soc_mem_sram.v, reporting into the SCRUB slot the map reserved
//        for it (soc_scrub.v). What is NOT: the core is still
//        SecureIbex = 0 with no lockstep, the fabric and the timers are
//        unprotected, and the NPU's transport, event engine and queue
//        storage are single points by the decision docs/52 measured
//        and docs/55 section 6 records. THE RAM IS 32 KiB, not 64: the
//        same four macros hold one protected word per row, and docs/67
//        section 3 is why that was cheaper than a seventh.
//   IS   interruptible, and the interrupts are real. soc_clint.v drives
//        irq_timer_i and irq_software_i, soc_gptimer.v and soc_uart.v
//        drive fast local interrupt lines the generated map assigns, and
//        the watchdog drives irq_nm_i. There is still no PLIC and
//        irq_external_i is tied low; docs/40 section 3 is the argument
//        for why that is a decision and not an omission, and the PLIC
//        region stays reserved and faulting.
//   IS   resettable BY ITSELF. rst_ni is now the POWER-ON reset. The
//        system reset the rest of this file runs on is derived from it
//        and from the watchdog's stage-2 request, so the SoC can reset
//        its own core while the watchdog keeps the evidence. See the
//        reset section below.
//   IS NOT the whole map. Four regions and ten peripheral slots are
//        reserved and unimplemented. An access to any of them takes a
//        bus error, on purpose: docs/39-soc-bus-and-memory-map.md
//        section 8 lists them.
//   HAS  one spacecraft interface, as of docs/65: a GRGPIO-shaped
//        16-pin GPIO port (soc_gpio.v) in the slot the map reserved for
//        it since docs/39, on the fast interrupt line docs/40 assigned
//        it. It is this project's own RTL and it is here first so that
//        the slot-to-driver-to-program path was walked once on a block
//        with no third-party dependency before any bus bridge is
//        written. The pins leave this module as three wires per pin
//        because there is no pad ring.
//   BOOTS FROM FLASH, as of docs/68. The boot ROM holds a LOADER, not
//        a program: it initialises every word of the RAM so the codec's
//        check bits exist before anything reads them, copies a
//        checksummed image out of the QSPI flash through soc_qspi.v,
//        and jumps to it. soc_boot.v is the BOOTREG slot the map has
//        carried reserved since docs/39 -- the bootstrap pins as they
//        were sampled, a boot counter no software can write, and a boot
//        report and an epoch word that survive the reset they describe.
//        The escalation when an image cannot be loaded is the
//        WATCHDOG's, reached by the loader declining to kick it; there
//        is no second ladder. docs/68 is the argument.
//   HAS  the one interface the NPU itself needs, as of docs/66: a
//        register-mode QSPI flash controller with two chip selects
//        (soc_qspi.v) in the QSPICTL slot on fast line 9. Software
//        drives flash transactions through it and the bring-up program
//        loads the NPU's weight image from a modelled flash through
//        it. The two execute-in-place windows QSPI3 and QSPI4 stay
//        reserved and faulting; soc_qspi.v's header says why.
//   IS   a NEUROMORPHIC SoC, as of docs/51-npu-integration.md.
//        soc_npu.v instantiates hw/rtl/pilot_top.v -- the frozen
//        TTIHP26b submission, unmodified -- reaches its register bank
//        over the same four serial pins the die will have, drives its
//        parallel AER port for events, and answers the 256 MiB NPU
//        window and the NPUCFG peripheral slot that the map has carried
//        empty since docs/39.
//
// SecureIbex IS FIXED AT 0, which is the owner's decision rather than
// this file's default: docs/38 section 10 item 4 records `small-pmp`
// chosen on 2026-08-31, RV32IMC plus PMP, no lockstep and no shadow
// register file.
//
// It also cannot be flipped here even if that decision were revisited.
// ibex_top.sv line 41 makes MemECC follow SecureIbex, so turning it on
// changes the MEMORY INTERFACE CONTRACT: the core then requires seven
// SECDED check bits alongside every instruction and data word and raises
// alert_major_bus_o on the first fetch without them -- docs/38 section
// 7.4 is the bring-up record of exactly that failure, where it presented
// as a catastrophic lockstep mismatch and was a missing testbench
// feature. The memories store check bits since docs/67, but NOT Ibex's:
// theirs are per BYTE LANE (four (16,8) codewords per RAM row) and per
// word for the ROM, corrected inside the memory and never carried
// across the fabric, whereas MemECC wants Ibex's own (39,32) delivered
// end to end on the bus. The integrity inputs stay tied to zero and are
// unused at SecureIbex = 0; docs/67 section 9 says what end-to-end
// integrity would still cost.

  // Reset
  // -------------------------------------------------------------------
  //
  // Two domains. The power-on reset reaches the four blocks whose state
  // has to survive a watchdog reset -- soc_gptimer (the watchdog inside
  // it), soc_busstat, soc_scrub and soc_boot. Everything else runs on
  // rst_sys_n, which the watchdog can pull -- that is its stage 2, and
  // it is the reason its own state has to be outside this domain
  // (soc_wdog.v W4).
  //
  // *Corrected 2026-09-11: this comment read "rst_ni is the power-on
  // reset and reaches only the watchdog". It reaches four instances and
  // has since soc_boot was added; the sentence was true when it was
  // written and nothing moved it. Two of the three TMR structures in
  // this design -- the watchdog's protected word and soc_boot's -- are
  // inside blocks it reaches, which is why the paragraph below matters
  // more than a naming fix.*
  //
  // BOTH RESETS ARE RELEASE-SYNCHRONISED, and until 2026-09-11 only one
  // of them was.
  //
  // rst_sys_n has been since it was written, for the reason its own
  // clause gives: rst_req is a registered signal in this clock domain,
  // so rst_sys_n would otherwise DEASSERT on a clock edge, which is a
  // recovery-time violation at every flop in the SoC.
  //
  // rst_ni had no such treatment and needs it for a different and worse
  // reason. It is an input PORT. Nothing in this design drives it, no
  // clock relates to it, and its release edge is asynchronous to clk_i
  // at every flip-flop it reaches -- including the 29 of the watchdog's
  // three replica banks and the 23 of soc_boot's. A release edge near a
  // clock edge can be captured by some flip-flops of a bank and not
  // others, so THREE REPLICAS CAN LEAVE RESET IN DIFFERENT CYCLES and
  // the voter's first reads are over a word no single replica holds.
  // The vote is a majority, so it survives one bank being late; it is
  // not designed to survive two, and nothing here bounds how many are.
  // soc_wdog.v's own header says this about `dis_i` -- "one
  // asynchronous pin fanned into three different combinational cones" --
  // and then says the release edge of rst_por_ni is the same problem,
  // that the hold-off makes the strap sample less sensitive to it
  // "without making it a synchronous release", and that "that is a
  // soc_top.v change and it is not made here". This is that change.
  //
  // Same shape as rst_sys_n's, one stage-pair, and clocked from rst_ni
  // ALONE so that nothing about the watchdog's own output can reach its
  // reset: W4 is a property of what this wire depends on, and it
  // depends on clk_i and rst_ni and nothing else.
  //
  // What it costs, stated because it is not nothing: the power-on domain
  // now needs TWO CLOCK EDGES before it leaves reset, where it used to
  // leave the moment the pin rose. On a part whose clock has not started
  // the watchdog therefore stays in reset -- which is the behaviour a

  // The second and third clock gates
  //
  // docs/57 found the FIRST one -- `u_ibex.core_clock_gate_i.u_icg`,
  // bound by hw/soc/rtl/prim_clock_gating.v, covering 2,323 of the
  // design's flip-flops -- and measured that the part idles at 16.3 %
  // of its busy power because of it. docs/61 section 7.3 then measured
  // that every one of the 2,178 flip-flops the accelerator brought is
  // on the UNGATED net, so that gate now covers 44.1 % of the design
  // rather than 79.9 %. These two are the answer to that.
  //
  // WHAT IS GATED AND WHAT IS NOT, with the reason in one line each:
  //
  //   u_bus     GATED. Its enable is proved complete by k-induction
  //             (soc_bus_props.v F10), so the gated fabric and the
  //             ungated one have the same state in every cycle and F1
  //             to F9 -- the fairness bound F9 included -- transport
  //             unchanged. That proof is the whole price of the gate.
  //   u_npu     GATED, as one domain including the frozen die. Its
  //             enable is conservative and measured rather than proved,
  //             for the reason soc_npu.v's own section gives.
  //   u_clint   NOT GATED, AND IT CANNOT BE. TICK_DIV = 1, so `mtime`
  //             increments and its SECDED codeword is re-encoded on
  //             every single clock edge (docs/58 H6). A complete enable
  //             for this block is the constant 1, and an incomplete one
  //             stops the architectural time base -- which is not a
  //             power saving, it is a different device. docs/57 section
  //             7.3 measured it as 52.4 % of all idle switching, so it
  //             is the largest single target in the SoC and it is the
  //             one that must not be taken.
  //   u_timer0  NOT GATED, same reason at a smaller size: the GPTIMER
  //             prescaler and the watchdog counter advance every cycle
  //             by construction. 24.6 % of idle switching.
  //   u_uart0   NOT GATED: the baud divider free-runs. 23.0 %.
  //   the rest  NOT GATED HERE. u_apb, u_pnp, u_gpio, u_qspi, u_scrub,
  //             u_busstat, u_boot and the two memories carry 237 of the
  //             468 non-core flip-flop bits docs/57 section 7.3 counted
  //             and 0.02 % of the idle switching between them. Each
  //             needs its own completeness argument and buys a share of
  //             a number that is already almost zero; docs/76 section
  //             14 ranks them and this document does not take them.
  //
  // The gates are instantiated HERE and not inside the two blocks, so
  // that every property in hw/soc/formal/ is still a property of a
  // module on an ungated clock. soc_bus.v's header says why that
  // matters and F10 is what makes it sound.
