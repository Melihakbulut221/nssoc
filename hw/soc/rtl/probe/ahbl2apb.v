// ahbl2apb -- AHB-lite slave port to APB3 master port.
//
// APB3 is a two-phase protocol: SETUP with PSEL high and PENABLE low,
// then ACCESS with both high, held until PREADY. An AHB transfer
// therefore costs a minimum of two bus cycles here and the AHB slave
// port has to insert wait states with HREADYOUT for all of them. That is
// unavoidable and is a property of APB, not of this implementation.
//
// Address and control are captured from the AHB address phase because
// the APB transfer outlives it. PWDATA is taken straight from HWDATA
// with no register: AMBA requires an AHB master to hold HWDATA valid for
// the whole of an extended data phase, so the data is still there when
// APB needs it. PRDATA is likewise passed straight out on HRDATA in the
// cycle HREADYOUT goes high, which avoids a second 32-bit register.
//
// Decode: PSEL is eight 4 KiB slots inside a 1 MiB window, taken from
// PADDR[19:12]. Only slots 0..7 exist, so PADDR[19:15] must be zero;
// anything else in the window is unmapped and gets the AMBA-mandated
// two-cycle ERROR response without any APB transfer being started.
//
// PSLVERR from the peripheral is likewise turned into the two-cycle AHB
// ERROR, which the ibex2ahbl bridge upstream collapses back into one
// Ibex rvalid with err set.
