// Word-addressed memory behind one system-bus slave port.
//
// SCOPE, stated first because it bounds every claim made with this file
// in the loop: this is a BEHAVIOURAL MODEL of a memory, not a memory.
// It infers a register array, it has no macro behind it and no wrapper
// for one. What it DOES carry, since docs/67, is the same code, the
// same correction and the same scrubber the macro build carries,
// because both instantiate hw/soc/rtl/soc_mem_ecc.v: the check bits a
// row stores, the byte lanes a write touches, the error a read answers
// with and the cycle on which the scrubber walks are ONE implementation
// with a register array under it here and six RM_IHPSG13 macros under
// it in soc_mem_sram.v. Until docs/67 this header said "no ECC, no
// scrubbing" and soc_top.v fixed SecureIbex to 0 for want of check bits
// no memory stored; the check bits are stored now, and soc_mem_ecc.v's
// header says how.
//
// What it is for: giving the fabric and the memory map something real to
// talk to, so that a compiled program can be fetched, executed and
// observed through the actual decode. That is what it is used for in
// hw/soc/tb/tb_soc.v and nothing more.
//
// Protocol: soc_bus.v rules S1-S4. Always ready (gnt = req), fixed
// response latency, in order by construction.
//
// RO = 1 makes it a ROM: a write is not performed and is answered with
// err, so a stray store into the boot ROM is a store access fault rather
// than a silent no-op.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// HARDEN -- THE CODE, AND THE TWO ARMS OF THIS FILE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// HARDEN = 0 is the model every document from docs/39 to docs/66 ran:
// one 32-bit register array, a read one cycle after the grant, byte
// enables applied straight to the word. It is kept byte for byte in the
// g_plain arm below, because it is the baseline docs/67 measures
// against and because sw/tests/test_soc_synthesis_guards.py's rule is
// that a baseline comes from the SAME file with the protection off.
//
// HARDEN = 1 is the g_ecc arm: the same 32-bit `mem` array -- named and
// indexed exactly as before, so every hierarchical read a testbench
// makes of it still reads the DATA -- beside a `chk` array holding the
// check field of each row, and soc_mem_ecc between the two and the bus.
// The two arrays together are one row of the macro build's 64-bit (or
// 39-bit) storage, and a testbench that injects an upset may land it in
// either.
//
// THE ROM'S CHECK BITS ARE COMPUTED AT LOAD, BY THE FROZEN ENCODER. A
// ROM built out of SRAM holds whatever loaded it, and in simulation
// what loads it is $readmemh; the check field is then derived word by
// word by driving each word through an instance of hw/rtl/secded_enc.v
// inside the same initial block. No H matrix is copied into this file
// and none could be: soc_mem_ecc.v's decoder is what will read those
// bits back, so a check field that came from anywhere but the
// repository's one encoder would make every fetch trap. In the macro
// build the ROM's contents AND its check bits are whatever writes the
// macro before the core leaves reset -- docs/67 section 8 is what that
// is -- and the same rule holds: they are loaded together or not at all.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// RDREG -- THE RESPONSE REGISTER, AND WHY A BEHAVIOURAL MODEL HAS ONE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// RDREG = 1 adds one pipeline stage to the response, so a granted
// request is answered TWO cycles later instead of one. Nothing about
// this model needs it: an inferred register array has no read arc worth
// breaking. It is here because hw/soc/rtl/soc_mem_sram.v needs it and
// because the two files must have the SAME PROTOCOL TIMING or every
// cycle count measured in simulation is a count for a different SoC.
//
// docs/50 is the measurement. The short version: the binding path of
// docs/47's sign-off starts at an SRAM macro's A_DOUT and the macro's
// own A_CLK -> A_DOUT arc is 9.5277 ns of a 20 ns period, so no amount
// of placement, routing or logic restructuring can reach the target
// while that arc and the whole read return path share one cycle. RDREG
// is the split.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not change gnt: this memory is still
// always ready and still accepts a request every cycle, so the extra
// cycle is LATENCY and not throughput. Two granted requests are in
// flight at once and their responses come back in order, one rvalid
// each, which is exactly what soc_bus.v's S1 and S3 already allow --
// see that file's protocol block, rule 3, "It may be one or more cycles
// after the grant".
//
// THE WRITE RESPONSE IS DELAYED TOO, and that is not an oversight. Rule
// 3 gives every granted request exactly one rvalid and rule 4 requires
// them in order. A memory that answered writes in one cycle and reads
// in two would reorder its own responses the first time a store
// followed a load, and the fabric's ownership queue would hand the
// load's data to whoever owned the store. Latency here is a property of
// the SLAVE, not of the access.
