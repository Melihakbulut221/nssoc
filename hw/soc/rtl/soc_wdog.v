// The watchdog.
//
// =====================================================================
// WHY THIS BLOCK IS NOT A TIMER WITH A RESET ON THE END
// =====================================================================
//
// `docs/38-ibex-bringup.md` section 10 item 4 chose Ibex `small-pmp`:
// no lockstep, no shadow register file. This project's TMR covers the
// NPU and the configuration state and does not reach inside the CPU. The
// consequence that decision records, in its own words, is that "the
// management processor is therefore the least hardened block in the
// design" and that "the watchdog in the docs/08 map is the only backstop
// currently planned, and resetting a core is a coarse instrument".
//
// So this watchdog is carrying weight a GRLIB GPTIMER's last timer was
// never designed to carry, and building it to that template would have
// been the wrong answer. `docs/40-interrupts-timers-watchdog.md` section
// 5 argues each of the five departures below. They are stated here as
// the specification the properties in
// hw/soc/formal/soc_wdog_props.v and the suite in
// hw/soc/tb/cocotb/test_soc_wdog.py are written against.
//
// W1. ARMED AT RESET AND NOT DISABLEABLE BY SOFTWARE. EN reads 1 out of
//     power-on reset and a write of 0 to it is ignored. There is exactly
//     one thing that can stop this block and it is not software: the
//     dis_i input, a bootstrap pin, sampled once when power-on reset
//     releases and never again. A watchdog whose watched software can
//     switch it off is not a backstop against software that has stopped
//     behaving, which is the only case it exists for.
//
// W2. ITS TIME BASE IS NOT SOFTWARE-PROGRAMMABLE. GRLIB's GPTIMER
//     watchdog shares the block's prescaler, and that prescaler is a
//     writable register -- so on a real GPTIMER, software that cannot
//     clear EN can still multiply the timeout by up to 1024 with one
//     store, which is the same thing with extra steps. Here the
//     watchdog has its own fixed divider, PRESCALE, that no register
//     reaches, and its counter is WIDTH bits. The longest timeout this
//     block can be talked into is therefore a constant of the netlist,
//         2^WIDTH * PRESCALE clocks,
//     and no value software can write to the reload register exceeds
//     it, because no such value fits. There is deliberately no clamp
//     register and no maximum-reload parameter: a bound enforced by the
//     width of a counter cannot be misconfigured, and one enforced by a
//     comparator can.
//
// W3. IT ESCALATES IN THREE STAGES RATHER THAN RESETTING.
//       stage 1  the counter reaches zero: raise nmi_o and reload.
//                Software gets one full timeout to notice, record and
//                recover. nmi_o goes to Ibex's irq_nm_i and NOT to a
//                maskable line, because the state this fires in is the
//                state where mstatus.MIE is quite likely already zero --
//                the core clears it on entry to every trap handler -- so
//                a maskable interrupt would simply never be taken.
//       stage 2  the counter reaches zero AGAIN with stage 1 still
//                unacknowledged: assert rst_req_o for RST_CYCLES. The
//                core is not involved and cannot prevent it.
//       stage 3  after ESCALATE watchdog resets since power-on: assert
//                wdog_o, the external pin, latched until power-on reset.
//                Resetting has demonstrably not worked and the decision
//                belongs to whatever is outside the chip.
//
// W4. ITS STATE SURVIVES THE RESET IT CAUSES. Everything in this file is
//     in the POWER-ON reset domain. rst_req_o drives the system reset;
//     nothing here is reset by it. So after a watchdog reset the boot
//     code can read WDOGSTAT and find WDOGRST set and RSTCNT non-zero,
//     and a watchdog reset is distinguishable from a power cycle. A
//     watchdog that erased its own evidence would leave the operator
//     with a machine that reboots for no discoverable reason, which is
//     the worst possible failure report from a spacecraft.
//
// W5. EVERY WRITE IS KEYED. No write to any register of this block has
//     any effect unless wdata[31:16] == KEY. The whole failure mode this
//     block guards is a processor executing something other than the
//     program, and such a processor stores wild values to wild
//     addresses; a single-bit "pet me" with no key is a watchdog a
//     runaway can pet by accident, and an unkeyed acknowledge bit is one
//     a runaway can hold in stage 1 forever by spraying stores at the
//     status register. The rule is therefore all writes and not just the
//     kick, and the value field of every register is consequently the
//     LOW half word -- which is why WIDTH may not exceed 16. GRLIB
//     leaves the upper half of these registers reserved, so this is a
//     documented divergence and not an incompatibility with a defined
//     field.
//
// =====================================================================
// ONE CONSEQUENCE THAT WAS NOT OBVIOUS AND IS NOT A CHOICE
// =====================================================================
//
// Entering stage 2 CLEARS the pending stage-1 NMI. It has to. Ibex
// initialises mtvec to boot_addr when it boots
// (ext/ibex/rtl/ibex_if_stage.sv, csr_mtvec_init_o), so at the instant
// the system reset releases the NMI vector is boot_addr + 0x7C -- four
// bytes BELOW the reset vector at boot_addr + 0x80, in ROM the image
// does not cover. A watchdog that held nmi_o through its own reset would
// therefore vector the freshly reset core into padding before it had
// executed a single instruction of the program. The reset supersedes the
// NMI; the fact that stage 1 happened survives in WDOGSTAT.
//
// =====================================================================
// W6. ITS OWN STATE IS PROTECTED WHERE CORRUPTION IS PERMANENT OR SILENT
// =====================================================================
//
// Added by docs/41-watchdog-hardening.md. docs/40 section 10 item 2
// recorded the gap in its own words -- "the block whose job is to catch
// upsets is itself unprotected" -- and the reason it is worse than an
// ordinary gap is that a watchdog an upset can silently disarm is worse
// than no watchdog, because the system believes it has one.
//
// THE RANKING. Not everything here deserves TMR, and the criterion is
// not "how important does the register sound". It is PERSISTENCE times
// SILENCE: what rewrites this register, and does its corruption
// announce itself?
//
//   Protected, because nothing rewrites it and its corruption is
//   silent. All of it lives in the power-on domain, so there is no
//   reset in the mission that restores it and no software write that
//   sets it:
//     dis_q     an upset to 1 sets armed low and the block STOPS. No
//               expiry, no NMI, no reset, for ever, with EN reading 0
//               and WDOGSTAT.DISABLED reading 1 on a board that never
//               asserted the pin. This is the single worst bit in the
//               design and it is the reason this section exists.
//     dis_seen  an upset to 0 re-opens the sampling window W1 closes,
//               turning a bootstrap pin back into a live one.
//     nmi_pend  an upset to 0 means stage 1 never becomes stage 2: the
//               watchdog warns and never acts, which is exactly the
//               failure W5's key check exists to stop software doing
//               and which an upset would do in hardware. An upset to 1
//               resets the system a full timeout early.
//     rst_seen  the record W4 exists for. An upset to 0 leaves the
//               operator with a machine that reboots for no
//               discoverable reason.
//     rst_count both a record and a policy: an upset up asserts the
//               external pin on a healthy part, an upset down means the
//               "resetting has not worked" signal never arrives.
//     rst_hold  the only state in this file that can assert a system
//               reset on its own; an upset down truncates the reset
//               pulse the rest of the SoC is being held by.
//
//   Deliberately NOT protected, because the block already rewrites it
//   and the worst case is bounded and loud:
//     counter   an upset moves the deadline by at most one full timeout
//               and is gone at the next expiry or kick, both of which
//               reload it. Nothing accumulates.
//     reload    an upset survives -- it is in the power-on domain too --
//               but it cannot survive an escalation, because a stage-2
//               reset restores it to the maximum (docs/40 section 7.2,
//               which found that the hard way). So the worst case is at
//               most one spurious ladder, and the protected state
//               records it correctly while it happens.
//     pre       an upset moves the tick by at most PRESCALE-1 clocks
//               out of 2^WIDTH * PRESCALE.
//   That list is a decision, not an omission, and
//   hw/soc/tb/cocotb/test_soc_wdog_fi.py injects into all three of them
//   so the price is measured rather than asserted.
//
// THE CONSTRUCTION. The protected bits are CONCATENATED into one word
// of PROT_W bits and that word is replicated three times under
// hw/rtl/tmr_voter.v. The bundling is not tidiness. Most of what is
// protected here is one-bit flags, and three replicas cannot be held
// apart over one bit -- there are exactly two storage functions, x and
// ~x, so a third replica is bit-for-bit identical to one of the others
// and yosys merges it away (hw/rtl/pilot_top.v section 8.2, generalised
// in docs/30 section 3.3: over W bits the affine transforms give
// 2 * (2^W - 1) coordinate functions, so three bits is the first width
// at which a third replica has functions left to take). Bundling buys
// the width. soc_tmr_bank.v carries the transform and the argument.
//
// THE POWER-ON DOMAIN CUTS BOTH WAYS AND THE BANK IS WRITTEN EVERY
// CYCLE BECAUSE OF IT. docs/40 section 7.2's finding -- state outside
// the reset domain makes the record survive AND makes stale
// configuration survive -- applies to the protection as well: the
// replicas are not reset either. A bank that only wrote when the value
// changed would repair a corrupted replica only at the next write, and
// `rst_seen` and the bootstrap latch are written once in a mission. The
// bank is therefore written unconditionally from the VOTED word on
// every edge, which makes the voter a continuous scrubber: the window
// in which a second INDEPENDENT upset in a different replica is
// uncorrectable is one clock cycle rather than the rest of the mission.
//
// CORRECTED 2026-09-09. That sentence read "a second upset" and bounded
// it at one cycle. It bounds ACCUMULATION OVER TIME and nothing else.
// docs/79 measured this design's own replica cells abutting on two
// hardens; a second upset from the SAME event is not separated in time
// at all, so there is no interval for this window to bound.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT BUY, stated here so it is not read as more:
//   * The unprotected registers above are still unprotected.
//   * Two upsets in two different replicas in the same cycle on the
//     same bit are not corrected. Nothing about three replicas claims
//     they are.
//   * The mismatch is COUNTED and STICKY in WDOGSTAT and nothing raises
//     an interrupt or a pin on it. Reading it is software's job, and
//     the software may be the thing that has failed -- docs/16 section
//     7.6, "DETECTED depends on someone looking".
//   * HARDEN = 0 removes all of it. That parameter exists so the area
//     cost can be measured like for like against the same file, and
//     because the synthesis guard needs a mutation whose flip-flop
//     count differs. Nothing in the design instantiates it, which
//     sw/tests/test_soc_synthesis_guards.py checks textually.
//
// =====================================================================
// W7. THE KICK HAS A CADENCE AND NOT ONLY A DEADLINE (the window)
// =====================================================================
//
// Added by docs/43-core-hardening.md, from a measurement rather than a
// preference. docs/42 section 7.2 measured this block catching 91.7 %
// of the upsets that leave the core dead -- and section 8.1 found the
// class it is structurally blind to: a machine that keeps executing its
// own instructions, in order, at full speed, and pets the watchdog on
// schedule while computing nothing.
//
// W1-W5 have no purchase on that, because none of them is about
// WHETHER THE SOFTWARE SHOULD STILL BE RUNNING. A watchdog that only
// asks "has a kick arrived within T" accepts any kick, at any moment,
// including one from a runaway that happens to sweep through the kick
// site far faster than the program ever would.
//
// So the kick now has a WINDOW. After a reload the counter runs from
// `reload` down to zero; the window is CLOSED while
//
//     counter > (reload >> WINS)
//
// and a kick that arrives while it is closed is a violation, not a
// kick. WINS is a four-bit field in the new WDOGWIN register:
//
//     WINS = 0   the window is open for the whole period. This is the
//                reset default and it is EXACTLY the block docs/42
//                measured: at zero, W7 is not merely disabled, it is
//                absent from the behaviour.
//     WINS = s   the window is open for the last 2^-s of the period, so
//                the minimum permitted interval between two kicks is
//                    T_min = T * (1 - 2^-s).
//
// WHAT THE WINDOW COSTS, STATED AS THE RULE A PROGRAM HAS TO OBEY.
// Every kick must land in (T_min, T]. Writing i_min and i_max for the
// shortest and longest interval between consecutive kicks that the
// software can ever produce, the constraint is
//
//     T * (1 - 2^-s)  <  i_min      and      i_max  <  T
//
// which forces
//
//     i_max / i_min  <  1 / (1 - 2^-s)
//
// so s is, exactly, a bound on the JITTER RATIO of the software's kick
// cadence: s = 1 permits 2:1, s = 2 permits 4:3, s = 3 permits 8:7.
// That is the whole cost, and it is a cost paid by the program and not
// by the hardware. A program that kicks from several places at unequal
// spacing -- which is the ordinary way to use a watchdog, and is how
// hw/soc/tb/sw/fi_workload.c was written before this -- has an
// unbounded jitter ratio and CANNOT use any s > 0. docs/43 section 4
// measures the ratio for that program and says what it had to become.
//
// AND WHAT IT DOES NOT BUY, said here because docs/42 section 10
// expected more of it than it can deliver. A window fires on a kick
// that is too EARLY. The x23 failure of docs/42 section 8.1 is a
// corrupted loop BOUND: the loop body is untouched, so the corrupted
// machine kicks at exactly the cadence the program was written to
// produce. It is not early. W7 does not catch it and cannot, and
// docs/43 section 5 measures that rather than asserting it. W8 is the
// mechanism that does.
//
// =====================================================================
// W8. A PHASE MAY ONLY ISSUE THE KICKS IT SAID IT WOULD (the budget)
// =====================================================================
//
// The generalisation of the x23 finding is that no check on the TIMING
// of a kick can distinguish "the right loop" from "the right loop, too
// many times". Only a bound on the amount of work can, and the software
// is the only thing that knows what that bound is.
//
// So a keyed write to WDOGWIN with BUDEN set loads KICKS into an
// eight-bit down-counter and arms it. Every accepted kick decrements
// it; a kick that arrives when it is already zero is a violation, in
// exactly the sense W7's early kick is. The contract is a statement
// about PROGRESS rather than liveness: "this phase will kick at most N
// times, and if it kicks more it is not my program any more".
//
// It is disarmed at power-on reset and by every stage-2 reset, so it is
// opt-in per phase, and a program that never writes WDOGWIN gets the
// block docs/42 measured, bit for bit.
//
// WHAT A VIOLATION DOES. Both W7's and W8's violations enter W3's
// ladder at the point an expiry would: stage 1 raises the NMI, and a
// second violation or expiry with stage 1 unacknowledged is stage 2.
// They deliberately do NOT reset immediately -- a spurious early kick
// from a program whose cadence drifted deserves the same one-timeout
// warning an ordinary expiry gets. A violating kick also does NOT
// reload the counter, because a kick the block has rejected must not
// be able to postpone the deadline it was rejected for.
//
// WHAT STOPS SOFTWARE FROM SIMPLY WIDENING IT (W1's question, asked of
// W7 and W8). Three answers, in increasing order of strength:
//
//   * The write is keyed like every other (W5). WINS and the budget are
//     no more reachable by a runaway storing wild values than `reload`
//     already is, and `reload` decides the timeout itself.
//   * Neither field can DISARM the block. WINS = 0 and BUDEN = 0
//     restore the conventional watchdog of docs/40, which still
//     expires, still escalates and still resets. That is a loss of the
//     new check, not of the old one, and it is the reason W7 and W8 are
//     compatible with W1 while a writable EN bit is not.
//   * An UPSET cannot widen them either: WINS, the budget's armed flag
//     and both violation records are fields of W6's protected word.
//     They are there by W6's own criterion -- software writes them once
//     per phase, nothing else rewrites them, and their corruption
//     toward zero is silent. `kick_left` is NOT protected, for the same
//     reason `counter` is not: the block itself rewrites it, an upset
//     up costs at most 255 further kicks before the budget still bites,
//     and an upset down is a spurious ladder, which is loud. docs/43
//     measures that price rather than asserting it.
//
// AND THE FAILURE docs/40 SECTION 7.2 FOUND, WHICH THIS FEATURE CAN
// REPRODUCE. A window installed before software went wrong would
// survive the reset that going wrong caused -- W4 puts it in the
// power-on domain -- and every kick of the fresh boot would be early,
// so the SoC would reset for ever with the console never reaching its
// first character. That is precisely the brick docs/40 section 7.2
// found with `reload`, and the fix is the same line: A STAGE-2 RESET
// RESTORES WINS TO 0 AND DISARMS THE BUDGET, beside the reload being
// restored to the maximum. Whatever the last software configured, the
// next boot gets the whole budget and no cadence contract at all.
//
// W9. THE RESET REQUEST IS REGISTERED, BECAUSE ITS CONSUMER IS
//     ASYNCHRONOUS AND SAYS SO.
//
//     `soc_top.v` builds the system reset as
//
//         wire rst_raw_n = rst_ni && !wdog_rst_req;
//         always @(posedge clk_i or negedge rst_raw_n) ...
//
//     and its own comment states the assumption that makes that safe:
//     "rst_req is a registered signal in this clock domain, so
//     rst_sys_n would otherwise DEASSERT on a clock edge". Until
//     docs/75 that assumption was FALSE. `rst_req_o` was
//     `(rst_hold != 0)`, a five-bit OR-reduce of a combinational
//     decode of the VOTED word -- and the voted word is the majority
//     of three replicas, two of which present `mix_dec` of their
//     storage, which is an XOR tree over all PROT_W flip-flops of the
//     bank. So on any edge that changed the protected word, twenty-nine
//     flip-flops per replica changed at twenty-nine slightly different
//     times, the two XOR trees passed through words the banks never
//     stored, and a value with a bit of `rst_hold` set could appear on
//     two of the three voter inputs at once for as long as the trees
//     took to settle. Two of three is a majority. There is no
//     synchroniser, no filter and no registered stage between that and
//     an asynchronous reset, and no static timing check anywhere in
//     this repository asks how wide a glitch on an asynchronous reset
//     is.
//
//     `docs/74` section 10.2 measured the consequence on the sign-off
//     netlist: 174 of 174 upsets into the replica banks were voted out
//     correctly -- the protection worked -- and every one of the 174
//     ALSO restarted the SoC, because correcting the upset is itself a
//     change of the protected word (the W6 report increments) and a
//     change of the protected word is what puts the glitch on the
//     reset. A correction that costs a reset is not a correction: W3's
//     ladder exists to reset a part that has stopped working, and an
//     upset the voter caught must not spend one of those.
//
//     The fix is one flip-flop and it changes no behaviour at all.
//     `in_reset_q` is the same predicate computed on the other side of
//     the register boundary -- from `prot_n`, before it is stored,
//     rather than from `prot` after -- so in the RTL the two are equal
//     on every cycle of every run and `rst_req_o` is the signal it
//     always was. In the NETLIST they are equal only once the decode
//     has settled, and the AND of a glitchy wire with a flip-flop that
//     is holding zero is zero. The masking is LOGICAL and not
//     structural, which is what makes it survive resynthesis: `abc` may
//     factor `(|rst_hold) & in_reset_q` any way it likes and every
//     product term it can produce still contains `in_reset_q`, because
//     proving it redundant would need sequential reasoning a
//     combinational mapper does not have.
//
//     WHAT THE ADDED FLIP-FLOP COSTS, stated rather than netted off.
//     It is one unprotected bit on the reset path, and it cannot be
//     tripled: `hw/rtl/pilot_top.v` section 8.2's bound says a one-bit
//     value has exactly two storage functions and three replicas need
//     three, and bundling it into the protected word would put it back
//     behind the very decode this requirement exists to get it out
//     from behind. So it is single, and the two directions of its
//     corruption are not symmetric:
//
//       * upset to 1 while the word says no reset: `rst_req_o` stays 0,
//         because the AND still has `in_reset` = 0. The upset is masked
//         by the term it was added to guard, which is the useful
//         direction and it is masked completely.
//       * upset to 0 during a genuine stage-2 stretch: `rst_req_o`
//         drops for one clock in the middle of a RST_CYCLES-clock
//         assertion. `soc_top.v`'s two-stage synchroniser needs two
//         clocks of `rst_raw_n` high before `rst_sys_n` rises, so a
//         one-clock notch does not reach the SoC's flip-flops. The
//         stretch is shortened by nothing and the reset still happens.
//
//     Neither direction is a way to reset the part, which is the
//     property that mattered. What remains is a coincidence: an upset
//     in `in_reset_q` in the same cycle as a change of the protected
//     word, which needs two events and is priced in docs/75 rather
//     than claimed to be impossible.
//
// =====================================================================
// WHAT THIS BLOCK DOES NOT DO
// =====================================================================
//
//   * No independent clock. It counts the system clock. If the clock
//     stops, the watchdog stops with everything else and nothing fires.
//   * It cannot tell a hung core from a core doing something slow and
//     legitimate. That is what the reload value is for and choosing it
//     is a software problem this block cannot solve.
//   * dis_i is a hole by construction: a board that ties it high has no
//     watchdog. It exists so that lab bring-up and gate-level debug do
//     not have to fight it, and WDOGSTAT.DISABLED says so out loud so
//     that a part in that state cannot claim to be protected.
