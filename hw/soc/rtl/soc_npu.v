// soc_npu: the CPU-side NPU interface, and the frozen pilot behind it.
//
// docs/39-soc-bus-and-memory-map.md section 9 item 4 is the gap this
// closes: "No NPU connection. The 256 MiB window is frozen and reaches
// the error slave." docs/51-npu-integration.md is the design argument;
// this header states the contract the argument produced.
//
// =====================================================================
// 1. TWO INTERFACES, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS
// =====================================================================
//
// Configuration and event flow are not the same problem and this module
// does not pretend they are. They have different rates, different
// latency tolerances, different transports on the die, and they land in
// different places in the frozen memory map -- which is not a
// coincidence, because regmap/memmap.yaml's author separated them
// before either existed.
//
//   THE NODE REGISTER WINDOW, on the system bus at SOC_BASE_NPU.
//   A memory-mapped view of one docs/10 section 10 register block per
//   mesh node, at NODE_ID * 0x1000, which is the per-node base address
//   docs/10 section 8 item 5 FREEZES. Low rate, latency tolerant,
//   ordinary loads and stores. Its transport is soc_npu_ser.v and a
//   register access costs about 172 clock cycles.
//
//   THE EVENT PORT, on the peripheral bus in the NPUCFG slot.
//   A pair of 16-bit AER event queues (docs/10 section 7.1 event words)
//   with a hardware engine between them and the die. This is the
//   datapath. An injection costs a write to one register and a
//   collection costs a read from another, both at APB rate, and the
//   engine does the transport work in the background.
//
// The split is why NPUCFG spends the interrupt and the node window does
// not: an interrupt is a datapath signal. docs/40 froze NPUCFG at APB
// slot 0x019 with source number 24 on fast local line 12 and this block
// occupies exactly that. It spends NOTHING that was spare -- lines 13
// and 14 are still unassigned -- and one line is enough for any number
// of nodes because the cause register, not the wire, says what happened.
//
// =====================================================================
// 2. THE TRANSPORT, AND WHY IT IS THE SERIAL ONE
// =====================================================================
//
// hw/rtl/pilot_top.v is INSTANTIATED HERE, unmodified, out of the
// directory docs/34-pilot-freeze.md pins by git blob hash. Not copied,
// not adapted, not given a parallel register port. Its register bank is
// reached the way the TTIHP26b die will be reached: four serial pins.
//
// The full argument is docs/51 section 3. The short form is that the
// die that comes back in 2027 has a serial port and nothing else, so a
// parallel port would make the SoC's model of the NPU unvalidatable
// against the only real hardware this project will ever have -- and the
// cost of avoiding that is 172 cycles on a register access that
// software performs a few dozen times per pass.
//
// hw/soc/flow/sim_soc.sh already reads hw/rtl/tmr_voter.v the same way,
// and the rule is the one every hardening document here has followed:
// hw/rtl/ is READ and never written.
//
// =====================================================================
// 3. THE DIE'S PARALLEL AER PORT IS USED, AND IT IS NOT SYMMETRIC
// =====================================================================
//
// pilot_top.v section 1's pin contract gives the event path its own
// pins, and this module uses them on the input side and cannot use them
// on the output side. That asymmetry is in the pin contract, not in
// this file:
//
//   INPUT.  AER_IN_ADDR[3:0] with AER_IN_TICK and a rising-edge
//   AER_IN_STB carries a SPIKE or a TICK, one per strobe, at four clock
//   cycles each. This module drives them, gated on AER_IN_RDY.
//
//   AND IT CANNOT CARRY A SYNC. The pin word's TYPE field is built
//   from AER_IN_TICK alone, so it is 00 or 01 and never 10. SYNC -- the
//   frame barrier that docs/10 section 7.1 makes the determinism and
//   multi-pass handshake primitive -- has no pin, and this module
//   injects it by writing the die's EVQ_IN register over the serial
//   transport instead. That is 172 cycles once per frame, not per
//   event.
//
//   OUTPUT.  AER_OUT_VLD says an event is presented and AER_OUT_ID[3:0]
//   is, in pilot_top.v's own words, "the low four bits of its ID
//   field". THERE IS NO TYPE ON THE OUTPUT PINS. A SYNC echo and a
//   spike from neuron 0 are the same four bits, and the barrier that
//   tells the sequencer a frame is complete is exactly what would be
//   lost by reading them.
//
//   So AER_OUT_VLD is used as a NOTIFICATION and the word is read from
//   the die's EVQ_OUT register, which pilot_top.v section 1 says "is
//   always available over the serial EVQ_OUT register". AER_OUT_ACK is
//   tied low and is never used: the serial read is itself the pop, and
//   two pop paths into one show-ahead register would be two ways to
//   lose the same event.
//
// The cost is stated rather than hidden: an output event costs a serial
// frame and an input SPIKE costs four cycles, so this port is ~43x
// faster inbound than outbound. That is the pin budget of a Tiny
// Tapeout tile showing through, and docs/51 section 8 measures it.
//
// =====================================================================
// 4. QUEUES
// =====================================================================
//
// Both queues are hw/rtl/aer_fifo.v, the proved queue the die itself
// uses, instantiated from the frozen directory for the same reason
// pilot_top is: a second event queue in this repository would be a
// second set of pointer, parity and drop semantics to get right. Its
// drop counter, its entry parity and its pointer voting come along.
//
// The capture queue needs a SHOW-AHEAD read, because the register view
// of EVQ_OUT is "read one word, see VALID and EVENT in the same
// access". aer_fifo is a registered-output queue, so the gap is closed
// by the one-entry adapter of pilot_top.v section 8 -- convention C9,
// whose reference implementation is that file's oh_valid/oh_data/oh_pop
// and whose alternatives that section already rejected.
//
// The injection queue needs no adapter, because the engine never has to
// peek: it POPS the head, holds it, and then decides which transport it
// takes. What it does need is a BOUNDED WAIT, because aer_fifo may
// legitimately answer a read with nothing -- an entry whose stored
// parity fails is DISCARDED and rd_valid is held low. A fetch that
// never returns would hang the engine, so it expires, counts, and
// reports. hw/rtl/pilot_top.v does the same thing at its own dispatcher
// for the same reason (docs/16 section 5.1).
//
// =====================================================================
// 5. WHAT IS NOT HERE
// =====================================================================
//
// No descriptor rings. docs/08 section 3.1 sketches "per-node SRAM
// apertures + descriptor rings" for this window and this block builds
// the apertures and not the rings, because a ring is a BUS MASTER and
// this fabric has two master ports, hardcoded, with a two-master
// round-robin arbiter whose fairness property is written for two.
// docs/51 section 9 prices it and states the event rate above which it
// pays for itself.
//
// No second node. N_NODES is a parameter, the window decodes all
// sixteen NODE_ID values docs/10 section 8 item 2 allows, and fifteen
// of them are a bus error.
//
// =====================================================================
// 6. WHAT IS HARDENED, AND WHAT THE MEASUREMENT SAID TO LEAVE ALONE
// =====================================================================
//
// Until docs/55 this header said "No hardening of anything this file
// adds", and docs/39 section 9 item 3 recorded the same for the whole
// SoC. docs/52 then measured the block -- 700 injections, seven strata,
// each run twice -- and RANKED WHAT TO PROTECT BY CONSEQUENCE rather
// than by size. Three things came out of it and they are built here.
// Every one of them names the number it rests on, because a hardening
// with no measurement behind it is the mistake docs/38 section 10 item 4
// names and this file is the second block in the SoC to avoid it.
//
//   H1. A BOUND ON THE FABRIC RESPONSE.  [7 of 7 dead machines,
//       docs/52 section 7.1; 5 in the transport's phase state, 2 in
//       `win_state`]
//       This block's ONLY lethal failure is a lost fabric response: a
//       frame that never ends, so busy_o never falls, so the window
//       never leaves W_WAIT, so rvalid never returns, and Ibex stalls
//       for ever. soc_npu_ser.v now bounds the frame; the window now
//       bounds its own wait, and both turn a dead machine into a LOAD
//       ACCESS FAULT the program can handle. The watchdog caught all
//       seven and its answer was a system reset; this is the cheaper
//       answer the campaign says is worth building.
//
//   H2. THE QUEUES' PROTECTION HAS SOMEWHERE TO REPORT.  [79 absorbed
//       upsets, 0 visible to any operator channel, docs/52 section 10]
//       `ptr_mismatch`, `par_err` and `rv_mismatch` used to leave the
//       two aer_fifo instances and go nowhere. They now do two things:
//       they raise a sticky bit in this block's own cause register, and
//       they leave the block as fault lines into BUSSTAT, where docs/44
//       already built saturating counters and stickies for exactly this
//       class of event. docs/51 section 14 item 1 declined this on the
//       grounds that a fault-counter block invented HERE would put
//       NPU-only telemetry outside BUSSTAT -- which is an argument about
//       WHERE THE COUNTERS LIVE and not about whether the events are
//       visible, and the counters live in BUSSTAT.
//
//   H3. THE CONTROL AND CAUSE BANK IS TRIPLED.  [16 false fault reports
//       in 100 draws, docs/52 sections 6.3 and 11.2]
//       The highest per-bit consequence anywhere in that campaign, and
//       note its SHAPE: it is not a missed fault, it is a FABRICATED
//       one. A fault-reporting channel that invents events is worse than
//       one that is merely lossy, because it will be believed, and every
//       recovery policy docs/09's S2 supervisor might implement reads
//       this register. docs/41 section 3.1's criterion -- persistent
//       times silent -- selects exactly these bits: software writes them
//       once, this block never rewrites them, and nothing votes, scrubs
//       or reports them.
//
// H4 AND H5 ARE docs/56'S, AND THE TWO OF THEM REST ON ONE MEASUREMENT
// THAT COULD NOT BE MADE BEFORE IT. docs/52 and docs/55 drew the event
// engine as ONE stratum of 140 bits contributing 1.71 of the
// connection's 4.17 points, and docs/55 section 14 item 1 made splitting
// it the PRECONDITION of hardening it, on the ground that an
// undifferentiated stratum is hardened by protecting its largest
// structure. Split into five and drawn 100 times each, the engine's
// silent corruption is not spread over it at all:
//
//     ev_data   64 bits, 45.7 % of the engine   0 of 100
//     ev_cnt    32 bits, 22.9 %                 0 of 100
//     ev_seq    19 bits                        13 of 100
//     ev_oh     19 bits                         6 of 100
//     ev_pin     6 bits                        18 of 100
//
// -- and per SITE, 96 % of the engine's whole rate is in NINE BITS:
// `aer_in_stb` (18 of 18 draws), `ev_state` (7 of 20), `oh_req` (3 of
// 4), `cap_wr_en` (5 of 8), `oh_valid` (2 of 4) and `inj_rd_en` (1 of
// 4). THE RATE IS IN THE STROBES AND NOT IN THE DATA. docs/56 section 3.
//
//   H4. THE SHOW-AHEAD ADAPTER'S READ IS BOUNDED.  [`oh_req`: 3 silent
//       wrong inferences in 4 draws, and a wedge no campaign reached]
//       The reason is a defect this file's own header describes and
//       applies to the OTHER queue -- a read of an aer_fifo may
//       legitimately return nothing, so it needs a bound -- and the
//       adapter had none. `oh_req` was cleared by `cap_rd_valid` alone
//       and the refill stood off on `!oh_req`, so ONE discarded capture
//       entry, or one upset that set that flag, stopped the block
//       delivering events FOR EVER while `cause[C_EVT]` went on saying
//       one was waiting. Measured both ways in: docs/56 section 5.1.
//
//   H5. THE AER STROBE IS GATED BY THE STATE THAT IMPLIES IT.
//       [`aer_in_stb`: 18 silent wrong inferences in 18 draws]
//       The highest per-bit rate in any campaign this block has had, on
//       ONE flip-flop, and the whole of `ev_pin`'s contribution. An
//       upset in it strobed a phantom SPIKE or TICK into the frozen die
//       with whatever the address and type pins held, and the die
//       accepted it. `aer_in_stb == (ev_state == E_PIN_S)` was already
//       an invariant of the FSM, so the redundancy was in the netlist
//       and was not being used; the pin is now the AND of the two and a
//       disagreement raises IRQ_CAUSE.AER_MM. IT COSTS NO FLIP-FLOP.
//       Section 9.
//
// AND TWO THINGS THE MEASUREMENT SAID TO LEAVE ALONE, which is the part
// of the ranking that keeps being counter-intuitive. `evq_data` -- the
// two queues' stored words and their entry parity -- is 41.2 % of the
// connection's flip-flops and 53.5 % of its area (docs/51 section 11),
// and it produced ZERO silent wrong inferences in 100 draws. The reason
// is occupancy: the queues hold a couple of live entries out of eight,
// so most of those 304 bits are storage nothing will read. A hardening
// wave that started with the biggest structure would have spent its
// whole budget there and bought nothing. NOTHING IN THIS FILE PROTECTS
// THE QUEUE STORAGE and docs/55 section 6 is why.
//
// docs/56 found the same shape one level down and it is now a rule
// rather than a coincidence: `ev_data`, the event word in flight, is 64
// of the engine's 140 bits -- the largest sub-stratum by a factor of
// three -- and came back 0 of 100, as did `ev_cnt`'s 32. NOTHING IN
// THIS FILE PROTECTS THE EVENT WORD EITHER.
//
// =====================================================================
// 7. THE REPLICATION BOUND, AND WHY THE BANK IS ONE WORD
// =====================================================================
//
// hw/rtl/pilot_top.v section 8.2 proves three replicas cannot be held
// apart over ONE bit -- there are exactly two storage functions, x and
// ~x -- and docs/30 section 3.3 generalises it: three bits is the first
// width at which a third replica has a function left to take. Almost
// everything H3 protects is one bit wide: `ctrl_in_en`, `ctrl_out_en`
// and each of the seven sticky cause bits. Replicating any of them on
// its own would give a netlist with ONE flip-flop and a voter voting it
// against itself, and every test and every proof in this repository
// would still pass.
//
// So they are BUNDLED into one PROT_W-bit word and the WORD is
// replicated, which is docs/41 section 4.2's answer and the move
// hw/rtl/pilot_top.v's own header names. The bank is
// hw/soc/rtl/soc_tmr_bank.v -- already built, already proved, already
// instantiated in the watchdog -- and the voter is hw/rtl/tmr_voter.v,
// read in place out of the frozen directory and not copied.
//
// TWO CONSEQUENCES OF THE BUNDLE, both stated rather than discovered.
//
//   * The bank has NO WRITE ENABLE: the whole word is written from the
//     voted value on every edge, which makes the voter a continuous
//     scrubber and bounds the exposure to a coincident second upset at
//     one clock cycle. soc_tmr_bank.v difference 1 is the argument. It
//     costs nothing here that it does not cost in the watchdog.
//   * THE REPORT IS INSIDE THE PROTECTED WORD. `sticky_cfg_tmr` is a
//     field of the bank, not a register beside it, so the write that
//     repairs a replica and the write that records the repair are the
//     same write on the same edge. docs/16 section 5.8 measured what the
//     other arrangement costs: an upset can erase the announcement of
//     the very event it caused.
//
// ONE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE FROM docs/41 SECTION 5.3, and it is the
// clearability of that report. The watchdog's `tmr_err` is NOT
// clearable, on the rule that a record software can erase is a record an
// upset can erase. Here every sticky cause bit IS write-1-to-clear,
// including this one, because IRQ_CAUSE is an INTERRUPT cause register
// whose entire contract is acknowledgement: a bit in it that could not
// be acknowledged would hold an enabled interrupt asserted for ever,
// which is docs/40 section 7.2's brick in a new place. The durable
// record lives in BUSSTAT's saturating counter instead, which is
// docs/44 section 6.4's argument for the same choice.
//
// WHAT IS STILL NOT PROTECTED, and it is most of the flip-flops. The
// transport's 40-bit shift register, the event engine's state, the
// window's captured request, the two queues' storage and both frame
// guards are single points by decision. docs/55 section 6 prices each
// one against what docs/52 measured of it, and docs/52 section 12 item 5
// is why parity over the shift register was declined.
// =====================================================================
// 8. H4's GUARD IS UNPROTECTED STATE, AND ITS CORRUPTION IS BENIGN
// =====================================================================
//
// docs/55 added twenty unprotected flip-flops whose upset FAILS A
// HEALTHY ACCESS -- the transport's guard, the window's guard and
// `win_out` -- and said so rather than netting it off. H4 adds three
// more, `oh_guard`, and they are different in kind, which is worth
// stating because "one more guard" would otherwise read as one more of
// the same trade.
//
// An upset that makes `oh_guard` expire early clears `oh_req` while a
// read may still be in flight. It cannot pop a second entry: the refill
// stands off on `!cap_rd_valid` and `!cap_rd_en`, so the earliest
// re-issue is two cycles later, by which time the in-flight read has
// either raised `cap_rd_valid` -- which sets `oh_valid` and blocks the
// refill -- or been discarded, which is the case the bound is for. And
// it cannot lose one, because nothing here touches `oh_valid` or the
// queue's pointers. THE WHOLE COST OF A SPURIOUS EXPIRY IS ONE NEEDLESS
// STICKY BIT. docs/56 section 6.4 draws into these three like any other
// site rather than assuming it.
//
// What H4 does NOT protect is the rest of the adapter. `oh_valid` and
// `oh_data` are single points: an upset that sets `oh_valid` makes the
// block hand software a stale word and report an event that is not
// there, and one that clears it loses the word the adapter is holding.
// docs/56 section 11 item 3 prices tripling the adapter's bundle
// against what the campaign measured of it and declines it in this wave,
// and section 10 of that document is the surviving exposure.
//
// =====================================================================
// 9. H5 COSTS NO STATE AT ALL, AND THAT IS WHY IT IS NOT ENOUGH
// =====================================================================
//
// H5 adds no flip-flop. `aer_in_stb == (ev_state == E_PIN_S)` is an
// invariant of the FSM below -- the flag is set on the edge out of
// E_PIN_A, cleared on the edge out of E_PIN_S, and the flush path
// clears it in the same statement that returns `ev_state` to E_IDLE --
// so the flag is a REDUNDANT ENCODING of a state this module already
// holds, and the pin is now the AND of the two. A spurious strobe needs
// two coincident upsets where it needed one.
//
// FOUR THINGS IT DOES NOT DO, and each is a decision rather than an
// oversight:
//
//   * IT DOES NOT CORRECT. On a disagreement the pin is held quiet.
//     That is the right answer when the FLAG was corrupted -- 18 of 18
//     of docs/56's draws -- and it LOSES AN EVENT when `ev_state` was,
//     and this module cannot tell which. `IRQ_CAUSE.AER_MM` says the
//     inbound path took an upset and does not claim to say more.
//   * IT DOES NOTHING FOR THE ADDRESS AND TYPE PINS. `aer_in_addr` and
//     `aer_in_tick` have no state that implies them, and docs/56
//     measured them at 0 of 65 and 0 of 17: a corrupted address on a
//     strobe that is not happening reaches nothing, and there is one
//     cycle per event in which it would.
//   * IT DOES NOTHING FOR `ev_state` ITSELF, which docs/56 measured at
//     7 of 20 and which is now the largest single site left in the
//     engine. Section 11 of docs/56 ranks it and says what it would
//     cost.
//   * AND IT IS NOT TMR. Tripling the flag is impossible on one bit
//     (section 7) and tripling the bundle would cost twelve flip-flops
//     and correct rather than mask. docs/56 section 6.1 prices that
//     against this and takes this one first because it is free, not
//     because it is stronger; section 11 item 5 is what it would still
//     buy.

  //   soc_bus.v's round-robin arbiter picks a winner BEFORE it looks at
  //   the target's grant, and its no-starvation property F9 has "every
  //   slave ready" in its antecedent for that reason (docs/39 section 8
  //   defect 3). So while a master is being refused HERE, the other
  //   master is not granted either.
  //
  // In this SoC that costs nothing measurable, and the reason is a
  // property of the CORE rather than of this file: Ibex is a two-stage
  // machine with no cache, so a load stalls the pipeline until its data
  // returns and no second request to this window is ever issued while
  // the first is in flight. docs/51 section 8 measures it rather than
  // asserting it. "Cannot happen because of the master we happen to
  // have" is not a property of a slave -- docs/39 section 8 defect 4 --
  // so it is measured and reported, not relied on.

  //                         including the descriptor-ring area, is
  //                         reserved and faults.
  //   node >= N_NODES    -> error.

  //                         index (pilot_top.v P2), so offsets 0x000 to
  //                         0x1FC are the whole reachable map.
  //   a write with be != 4'hF or a misaligned address -> error. The

  // THE GRANT IS QUALIFIED ON THE HANDSHAKE AND NOT ON THE STATE ALONE,
  // for the reason the bound below is armed by the grant and not by the
  // state, and it is the same defect one level up.
  //
  // `win_state == W_IDLE` says this FSM believes it is free. `win_out`
  // says the FABRIC is still owed an rvalid. The two move together in
  // every cycle of a healthy access -- `win_out` is set on the only
  // transition out of W_IDLE and cleared by the `rvalid_o` that W_RESP
  // raises as it returns -- so on a healthy part this term is always
  // true and changes nothing. They come apart on exactly docs/52's
  // sixth dead machine: `win_state` bit 1 flipped takes W_WAIT to
  // W_IDLE with a granted request unanswered, and the unqualified form
  // then ADVERTISES THE SLAVE AS FREE WHILE IT OWES A RESPONSE.
  //
  // What that costs is not one wrong response, it is the bound. A grant
  // in that state restarts the window -- W_IDLE captures the new
  // payload and goes to W_ISSUE -- and `win_guard` is cleared by
  // `gnt_o`, so the counter that was five cycles from expiring goes back
  // to zero. A master that holds `req_i` up, which is what Ibex's
  // prefetch buffer does, re-arms it on every access for ever and the
  // bound never fires: the slave stays exactly one rvalid short of the
  // fabric's response-ownership queue and every later response goes to
  // the wrong master. The bound docs/55 section 8.2 built to catch this
  // shape is defeated by the grant that the same shape lets through.
  //
  // WHY THE SECOND TERM IS `|| rvalid_o` AND NOT JUST `!win_out`. The
  // block above says it out loud: W_RESP returns to W_IDLE in the cycle
  // it raises `rvalid_o`, and `win_out` is not cleared until the end of
  // that same cycle, so a healthy back-to-back access is granted in a
  // cycle where `win_out` is still 1. `!win_out` alone would insert a
  // dead cycle into every back-to-back pair of accesses -- a
  // performance change on the healthy path, in a slave that already
  // costs 172 cycles -- and would do it to fix nothing, because the
  // response the fabric is owed is ON THE WIRE in that cycle. The
  // disjunction is soc_bus.v rule 3 read literally: refuse only while a
  // response is owed AND not being returned.
  //
  // The assignment itself is BELOW the `win_out` block and not here,
  // where the decode it reads is: `win_out` is a reg and Verilog-2005
  // wants it declared before it is used, and its declaration belongs
  // with the argument for it rather than being pulled up here.

  // -------------------------------------------------------------------
  // THE BOUND IS ARMED BY THE GRANT AND NOT BY THE STATE, and the first
  // version of it was armed by the state and MISSED TWO OF THE SEVEN
  // RECORDS IT WAS BUILT FOR.
  //
  // That version ran the counter while `win_state` was W_ISSUE or
  // W_WAIT, on the reasoning that those are the two states that can wait
  // for ever. docs/55 section 8.2 replayed docs/52's seven dead machines
  // against it: the five in the transport's phase state were converted
  // to a bus error, and the two in `win_state` itself were still dead,
  // with `win_to` reading ZERO. The bound had not fired.
  //
  // The reason is that the failure is not the one the state-armed
  // version modelled. `win_state` bit 1 flipped at cycle 566 takes
  // W_WAIT (2) to W_IDLE (0): the window does not WAIT for ever, it
  // FORGETS that it was waiting. The fabric has granted a request and
  // soc_bus.v rule 3 says this slave owes exactly one rvalid for it; the
  // window has dropped back to idle owing one, and a counter that runs
  // only in W_ISSUE and W_WAIT is not running.
  //
  // So the thing that is bounded is THE OUTSTANDING REQUEST, which is a
  // fact about the fabric handshake and not about this FSM's encoding: a
  // grant happened and the rvalid it obliges has not been returned. That
  // covers both shapes with one counter -- a window that waits for ever
  // and a window that forgets -- and it has a second property the
  // state-armed version did not: the bound can never manufacture an
  // rvalid the fabric was not expecting, because `win_out` is set by a
  // grant and by nothing else.
  //
  // ONE MORE FLIP-FLOP, AND IT IS UNPROTECTED. An upset that clears
  // `win_out` while a request is outstanding re-opens the hang the bound
  // closes; an upset that sets it produces one spurious rvalid. Both are
  // in the campaign's `window` stratum and docs/55 section 8.4 reports
  // what the draws found.

  // "the window is busy and NO response is owed", and docs/52's seventh
  // dead machine is that one: `win_state` bit 0 flipped at cycle 5,658

  // then issues a serial frame nobody asked for and, when it completes,
  // RAISES rvalid_o WITH NO GRANT BEHIND IT -- a response into a fabric
  // that is not expecting one. soc_bus.v keeps one response-ownership
  // queue per slave and rule 3 is exactly one rvalid per granted
  // request; a spurious one puts that queue out of step and every later
  // response goes to the wrong master.
  //
  // A timeout cannot see it, because nothing is waiting. What sees it is
  // that the FSM's state DISAGREES WITH THE HANDSHAKE: `win_out` is the
  // fabric's own record of whether this slave owes anything, and a
  // window that is not idle while owing nothing is in a state no grant
  // put it in.
  //
  // IT IS UNREACHABLE WITHOUT A FAULT, and by construction rather than
  // by argument: `win_out` is set on the same edge as the only
  // transition out of W_IDLE, both arms of it -- W_ISSUE for a good
  // access and W_RESP for a bad address -- and it is cleared by
  // `rvalid_o`, which W_RESP raises in the cycle it returns to W_IDLE.

  // -------------------------------------------------------------------
  // H4: THE SHOW-AHEAD'S READ IS BOUNDED. Header section 8.
  //
  // Until docs/56 the sentence where this counter now sits read:
  //
  //   "A read whose entry fails its parity check returns no rd_valid;
  //    oh_req simply stays set until the next entry arrives, and the
  //    queue's own level tells software the difference."
  //
  // THAT IS FALSE AND IT IS FALSE IN THE ONE DIRECTION THAT MATTERS.
  // `oh_req` is cleared by `cap_rd_valid` and by nothing else, and the
  // refill below requires `!oh_req`. So a read that produces no
  // `rd_valid` leaves `oh_req` set for ever, no further `cap_rd_en` is
  // ever issued, and EVERY LATER EVENT IS STRANDED IN THE CAPTURE QUEUE
  // -- while `cause[C_EVT]` goes on reporting that an event is waiting,
  // because it reads `!cap_empty`. A driver polling EVQ_OUT polls for
  // ever. docs/56 section 5.1 measures both ways in.
  //
  // The precedent is TWENTY LINES UP IN THIS FILE'S OWN HEADER, applied
  // to the other queue: "aer_fifo may legitimately answer a read with
  // nothing -- an entry whose stored parity fails is DISCARDED and
  // rd_valid is held low. A fetch that never returns would hang the
  // engine, so it expires, counts, and reports." The engine's E_FETCH
  // does exactly that. The adapter did not, and the two reads have the
  // same failure because they are reads of the same queue type.
  //
  // THE BOUND IS DERIVED AND NOT WRITTEN DOWN. `aer_fifo` registers
  // `rd_valid` from `rd_ok = rd_en && !empty`, so a healthy read raises
  // `cap_rd_valid` exactly one cycle after `cap_rd_en`, and `oh_req` is
  // high for the `cap_rd_en` cycle and the `rd_valid` cycle and no
  // others:
  //
  //   OH_WAIT   = 1 (the cap_rd_en cycle) + 1 (the rd_valid cycle) = 2
  //   OH_MAX    = OH_WAIT + OH_SLACK                               = 4
  //   OH_GUARD_W= $clog2(OH_MAX + 1)                               = 3
  //
  // The guard counts cycles in which `oh_req` is set, so on a healthy
  // read it reaches exactly OH_WAIT and never more.
  //
  // `test_the_show_ahead_bound_never_fires_on_a_healthy_read` reports
  // the largest guard it saw over a real inference and requires it to be
  // exactly OH_WAIT, so the bound, the read and the declared slack are
  // three numbers that agree rather than three that are consistent.
  //
  // THE COMPARISON IS `>=` AND NOT `==`, for docs/55 section 4.2's
  // reason: an upset that pushed the counter above the bound would
  // otherwise wrap and take another 2^OH_GUARD_W cycles, rebuilding the
  // stall inside the guard that exists to stop it.
  //
  // ON EXPIRY IT CLEARS `oh_req` AND DOES NOTHING ELSE -- no read is
  // issued here and `oh_valid` is not touched. That matters, and it is
  // why this guard's own corruption is BENIGN where docs/55's two are
  // not (header section 8): the refill below stands off on
  // `!cap_rd_valid` and `!cap_rd_en`, so the earliest a re-issue can
  // happen is two cycles after the expiry, by which time a read that
  // was genuinely in flight has either set `oh_valid` -- which blocks
  // the refill -- or been discarded. A SPURIOUS EXPIRY THEREFORE CANNOT
  // POP A SECOND ENTRY AND CANNOT LOSE ONE. What it costs is one
  // needless `IRQ_CAUSE.OH_TO`.

  // of the interlock the header states three paragraphs above: a full
  // EVQ_OUT on the die stalls its update pipeline, a stalled pipeline
  // stops consuming EVQ_IN, and a full EVQ_IN is exactly what holds
  // E_DECIDE. The only thing that unblocks the die is a DRAIN, and
  // E_DRN_RQ was reachable from E_IDLE alone. Reproduced with the pilot
  // in the loop, no upset injected, in
  // hw/soc/tb/cocotb/test_soc_npu_defects.py: eight spikes and a tick
  // into an 8 x 8 node with the host not draining leaves `ev_state` at
  // E_DECIDE and `node_aer_in_rdy` low for ever, and turning CTRL.OUT_EN
  // on afterwards -- which is the operator's whole recovery -- changes
  // nothing, because nothing in E_DECIDE ever looks at it again.
  //
  // THE REVIEW'S SUGGESTION WAS "GO TO E_DRN_RQ", AND ON ITS OWN IT
  // LOSES AN EVENT. E_DRN_RQ and E_DRN_W both end at E_IDLE, and E_IDLE
  // pops the next word out of the injection queue. The event already
  // sitting in `ev_word` -- popped, counted against nothing, never
  // delivered -- would be silently dropped, and docs/10 section 7.2 is
  // that spikes are never dropped. So the diversion has to be a
  // DETOUR AND NOT A RESTART, and this bit is what makes it one: set on
  // the way out of E_DECIDE, tested by E_DRN_W, which returns to
  // E_DECIDE with `ev_word` untouched instead of to E_IDLE.
  //
  // ONE MORE FLIP-FLOP, AND IT IS UNPROTECTED, on soc_npu.v's own
  // accounting for `win_out` and `oh_guard`. Its two corruptions are not
  // symmetric and neither is a new way to lose an event:
  //
  //   * upset to 1 with no detour in progress: the next drain that
  //     completes returns to E_DECIDE instead of E_IDLE. `ev_word` still
  //     holds whatever it last held, so the engine either re-delivers
  //     one event or -- if that word was a SYNC -- sends one extra
  //     serial frame. It is a DUPLICATE, which the die counts, and the
  //     engine leaves E_DECIDE by its normal exits.
  //   * upset to 0 during a detour: the drain completes and the engine
  //     returns to E_IDLE, which is the pre-fix behaviour for that one
  //     event -- it is dropped. One event, once, and the deadlock is
  //     still gone.
  //
  // *Corrected 2026-09-11. This read "It is NOT in
  // `hw/soc/fi/npu_targets.py`, so no campaign draws into it yet and the
  // two paragraphs above are reasoning and not measurement." It went in
  // on 2026-09-10 and the SAME COMMIT that wrote it added the site --
  // `npu_targets.py`'s `ev_seq` stratum carries `ev_resume` and has
  // since 26f4494, which is also where this sentence landed. Two edits
  // in one change, one of them describing the other's absence.*
  //
  // It IS a site. `ev_seq` went from 19 bits to 20 when it was added, so
  // that stratum's draws are not comparable with `docs/52`'s, `docs/55`'s

  // THE CLOCK-GATE ENABLE
  //
  // docs/57 section 9 measured that this block multiplies the SoC's idle
  // power by 5.588 and docs/61 section 7.3 measured why: every one of
  // the 2,178 flip-flops `soc_top` gained when this module arrived is on
  // the UNGATED clock net, because the design's one `sg13g2_lgcp_1` is
  // bound inside `ibex_top` and gates Ibex and nothing else. This is the
  // enable for the second one.
  //
  // IT IS ONE DOMAIN AND NOT SEVERAL, and the reason is the transport
  // rather than a preference. `soc_npu_ser` generates `ser_sck` from
  // `clk_i` by division, and `pilot_top` samples that pin on `clk`. Two
  // domains -- the CPU face clocked, the die not -- would make the
  // die's serial port a clock-domain crossing between a divided clock
  // and a stopped one, which is a real CDC in a block that has none and
  // cannot be given one, because `hw/rtl/pilot_top.v` is frozen by
  // docs/34 and only its clock can be reached from outside. The die
  // stops with the transport or not at all.
  //
  // WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM soc_bus.v's. That module's enable is
  // PROVED complete -- hw/soc/formal/soc_bus_props.v F10, k-induction,
  // and every one of its five terms is load-bearing under mutation. No
  // such proof is available here: the state this enable has to cover
  // includes 2,152 flip-flops inside a frozen submission whose property
  // set is `formal/` and is not this project's to extend. So the enable
  // is made CONSERVATIVE in two independent ways and then MEASURED:
  //
  //   1. `npu_act` names every reason this block or the die behind it
  //      could have work to do, including every reason it could have a
  //      FAULT to record. That second class is not decoration and it is
  //      the one thing gating a fault-tolerant block gets wrong by
  //      default: a voter's correction and a queue's parity discard are
  //      observed by soc_busstat.v, and a block with no clock cannot
  //      report them. `|sticky_ev` carries all NINE -- the queue
  //      pointer votes, the entry parity, the cause bank's own voter,
  //      the strobe mismatch and the four bounded waits -- so an upset
  //      inside a sleeping accelerator wakes it up rather than being
  //      lost.
  //
  //   2. `wake_hold` keeps the clock running for HOLD_CYCLES more
  //      cycles after the last of those goes away, so a settling chain
  //      inside the die -- pilot_top.v's two-flop input synchronisers,
  //      for instance -- is not cut off by a term nobody wrote down.
  //      This is insurance and it is priced: HOLD_CYCLES cycles of
  //      clock per wake, against 2,178 flip-flops of clock per idle
  //      cycle.
  //
  // AND THE MEASUREMENT IS hw/soc/flow/clkgate_check.py, which reads a
  // whole-SoC dump and reports every bit under this module that changes
  // value at an edge the gate would have removed. Zero is the result
  // that licenses the gate, and it is a statement about the workloads
  // measured and not a theorem.
  //
  // `win_guard` and `oh_guard` are in the list for a reason worth
  // stating: both are cleared to zero the cycle AFTER the thing they
  // were counting goes away, so leaving them out would freeze a stale
  // non-zero count. Neither can cause a spurious expiry -- both
  // expiries are qualified by `win_out` and `oh_req` -- so this is not
  // a correctness term. It is there because the verification instrument
  // is bit-exact equivalence with the ungated design, and a design that
  // is only ALMOST equivalent cannot be checked that way.


  // -------------------------------------------------------------------
  // docs/77: THE SPLIT, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE ONE docs/76 RANKED FIRST
  //
  // docs/76 section 9.5 measured that this gate's clock-gating check
  // misses by 5.0198 ns at the slow corner and attributed the cone to
  // `|sticky_ev`. It is not that cone. Measured on that document's own
  // signed-off netlist by cutting launch domains one at a time
  // (docs/77 section 3): the worst path into this enable that starts
  // inside this block -- which is where every one of the eleven fault
  // lines starts -- is -1.3129 ns, the worst that starts in the ungated
  // domain is -2.6166, and the -5.0198 launches from
  // `u_ibex.gen_regfile_ff.register_file_i.raddr_a_i[2]`, the flip-flop
  // that also gives the whole design its -6.3505 WNS. The enable's late
  // input is `req_i`, and `req_i` is the CPU's register-file read
  // address after the ALU, the load-store address, the fabric's address
  // mux and the slave decode. THE FAULT LINES ARE NOWHERE ON IT.
  //
  // So the split below is by ARRIVAL and not by importance:
  //
  //   FAST -- `req_i` and `psel_i`. These are the only two things that
  //   can rise and fall while this block's clock is stopped, because
  //   they are driven from outside it, and a request that is not seen
  //   at the edge that ends its own cycle is a request this block has
  //   answered `gnt_o` to and then dropped. They stay combinational.
  //
  //   SLOW -- everything else, including eight of the nine fault
  //   lines; the ninth is C_INJ_OVF, which carries `psel_i` and is
  //   therefore already covered by the fast half. (docs/76 called them
  //   eleven in three places and this file did too. NSTICKY is
  //   NCAUSE - C_STICKY0 = 14 - 5 = 9, and nine is what the nine
  //   `assign sticky_ev[...]` lines above come to; docs/77 section 13.)
  //   Every term of `npu_act_slow` is a function of THIS BLOCK'S
  //   REGISTERS -- the die's outputs included, because `pilot_top` is
  //   clocked by the same gated clock and its outputs are therefore
  //   functions of its own registers. A function of registers that
  //   are not being clocked CANNOT PULSE AND VANISH: it rises when the
  //   upset lands and it stays up until the block is clocked. So
  //   registering it costs one cycle of latency on the wake and loses
  //   nothing at all -- which is the whole of what `|sticky_ev` is in
  //   the enable for, kept, and moved off the timing path.
  //
  // THE SIDE CONDITION IS MACHINE-CHECKED AND NOT ASSERTED.
  // `sw/tests/test_soc_clkgate_guards.py` elaborates this module in
  // yosys, flattens it, walks the fan-in cone of `npu_act_slow` cut at
  // every sequential cell, and fails if ANY input port is reachable.
  // That is what makes "a function of this block's registers" a
  // measurement rather than a claim, and it is the condition the
  // theorem in docs/77 section 6 needs. It is also what found
  // C_INJ_OVF, which was not in anyone's list.
  //
  // WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not close the check. The floor is
  // `req_i`'s own arrival, and docs/77 section 9 measures it: at the
  // slow corner the CPU-derived signal reaches this enable AFTER the
  // check's required time, so the check fails with the enable's logic
  // deleted entirely. Closing it needs `gnt_o` qualified by wakefulness
  // -- a fabric-visible cycle on every wake -- which docs/77 section 11
  // priced and did not take, and which WAKE_GNT now builds behind a
  // parameter that defaults to off (docs/77 section 18); the parameter's
  // own comment at the top of the file is the argument.
