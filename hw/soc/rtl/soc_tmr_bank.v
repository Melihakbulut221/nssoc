// soc_tmr_bank: one physical replica of a TMR domain in the SoC.
//
// =====================================================================
// WHERE THIS COMES FROM, AND WHAT IS DIFFERENT
// =====================================================================
//
// This module is derived from `pilot_cfg_bank` in hw/rtl/pilot_top.v --
// the same POL + MIX storage transform, the same two unit-triangular
// XOR layers, the same reasoning. It is a separate module in hw/soc/rtl
// rather than a reuse of that one for two reasons, both mechanical:
//
//   * `pilot_cfg_bank` is declared inside hw/rtl/pilot_top.v, a file
//     that also declares the whole NPU pilot and includes npu_regs.vh.
//     Reading it into the SoC's synthesis and simulation flows to get
//     one bank module would drag the pilot's elaboration in with it.
//   * docs/34-pilot-freeze.md pins every file in hw/rtl by git blob hash
//     for the TTIHP26b shuttle, so that file cannot be split.
//
// hw/rtl/tmr_voter.v is a different case and is NOT copied: it is a
// standalone 61-line file with no includes, so hw/soc reads it in place.
// Nothing in hw/rtl is modified by this work.
//
// Three deliberate differences from `pilot_cfg_bank`:
//
//   1. NO PER-BIT WRITE ENABLE. The whole word is written on every clock
//      edge. This is not a simplification for its own sake; it is the
//      answer to the problem docs/40 section 7.2 found in this domain.
//      Everything in soc_wdog.v lives in the POWER-ON reset domain, so
//      there is no reset that ever cleans up after an upset -- the
//      watchdog's own reset does not reach it, and a power cycle is the
//      end of the mission's uptime. A bank that HOLDS its value repairs
//      a corrupted replica only when the value is next written, and a
//      register such as `rst_seen` or the bootstrap latch is written
//      once and then never again. So a held bank in this domain
//      accumulates corruption: the first upset is masked, the second in
//      a different replica on the same bit is not, and nothing in
//      between rewrites the first. Writing unconditionally makes the
//      voter a continuous scrubber: the corrected word goes back into
//      all three replicas on the very next edge, so the domain is
//      exposed to a second INDEPENDENT upset for one clock cycle rather
//      than for the mission. That is a bound on accumulation over time
//      and on nothing else -- corrected 2026-09-09, it read "coincident".
//      docs/79 measured replicas of this shape sharing rows and
//      abutting, so a single event reaching two of them is not bounded
//      by this at all.
//
//      That is also why this bank is cheaper than pilot_cfg_bank per
//      bit: with no partial write there is no read-modify-write, so the
//      MIX replica needs no decode-substitute-encode mux, only the
//      encode on the way in and the decode on the way out.
//
//   2. MIX IS AVAILABLE ON MORE THAN ONE REPLICA, and soc_wdog.v uses it
//      on two. pilot_cfg_bank pays for the mixing once because
//      polarity alone already separates A from B where merging happens.
//      That is true, and docs/33-rail-transform.md then measured what it
//      costs: to separate B from A on EVERY bit, POL_B has to be all
//      ones, which makes B's reset image all ones, which is a flip-flop
//      dfflibmap has to build by inversion, and abc folds the inversion
//      against the bank's own correction. The polarity is erased at
//      technology mapping. It does not matter there, because dfflibmap
//      runs after the last pass that can merge anything -- but it means
//      the artifact carries one defence where the RTL states two.
//
//      Giving B the mixing too removes the need for POL_B to be all
//      ones: B and C are separated from A by the weight of their stored
//      functions and from each other by POL_B = ~POL_C, so both POL
//      masks can be mixed patterns and neither reset image is uniform.
//      Whether that survives technology mapping is a measurement, not an
//      argument, and it is made in docs/41 section 6 rather than
//      asserted here.
//
//   3. AN ELABORATION GUARD ON W >= 4, which pilot_top.v carries at the
//      instantiation and this module does not have. It is here because
//      the whole point of this bank in the SoC is that one-bit and
//      two-bit flags are BUNDLED into it -- see below -- and a future
//      edit that narrowed the bundle would silently disarm MIX.
//
// =====================================================================
// THE REPLICATION BOUND, AND WHY THE BUNDLE IS THE ANSWER
// =====================================================================
//
// hw/rtl/pilot_top.v section 8.2 proves that three replicas cannot be
// held apart over ONE bit: there are exactly two storage functions, x
// and ~x, so a third replica is bit-for-bit identical to one of the
// other two and opt_merge hashes it away.
// docs/30-dispatcher-protection.md section 3.3 re-derives the general
// statement: over W bits the affine transforms give 2 * (2^W - 1)
// coordinate functions -- 2 at W = 1, 6 at W = 2, 14 at W = 3 -- and
// three replicas need six distinct ones, so THREE BITS is the first
// width at which a third replica has functions left to take.
//
// The state this bank protects in soc_wdog.v is mostly one-bit flags:
// the bootstrap latch, the stage-1 pending flag, the reset record. None
// of them can be tripled on its own. They are therefore concatenated
// into a single word of PW bits and this bank replicates the WORD, which
// is the move hw/rtl/pilot_top.v's header already names ("state bundled
// into one W >= 4 bank so that MIX applies") and which docs/30 could not
// make for `dstate` because that state is two bits and has nowhere else
// to go. Here the bits are all in one module and all in one reset
// domain, so the bundle is free.
//
// =====================================================================
// WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO
// =====================================================================
//
//   * It does not vote. It is one replica. The voter is
//     hw/rtl/tmr_voter.v and the instantiating block owns it.
//   * It does not report. A replica cannot know it is the odd one out.
//   * It does not resynchronise itself. Resync here is the
//     unconditional write from the voted word, and that belongs to the
//     instantiating block because only it knows what the next value is.
//   * It claims nothing about the MAPPED netlist. What POL and MIX buy
//     is that no two replicas present the same stored function to the
//     structural hashing in `opt_merge`, which runs before technology
//     mapping. Whether the mapped cells are still distinguishable is a
//     separate question, docs/33 is the record of getting that
//     distinction wrong once, and the evidence that the defence held is
//     the FLIP-FLOP COUNT in sw/tests/test_soc_synthesis_guards.py.
