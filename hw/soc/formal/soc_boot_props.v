// BOOTREG, stated as properties.
//
// Textually included at the end of the soc_boot module body under
// `ifdef FORMAL, the arrangement every other fabric block uses.
//
// The set is short because the block is, and because the thing worth
// proving about it is not arithmetic -- it is an ACCESS property. The
// whole argument of hw/soc/rtl/soc_boot.v's header is that the one
// field with authority is the one software cannot write, and that is a
// statement about every reachable APB transaction, which is exactly
// what a proof is for and exactly what a directed suite can only
// sample.
//
//   D1  THE BOOT COUNTER IS NOT WRITABLE. No APB write of any value to
//       any offset changes it. This is the block's reason for existing,
//       and it is D1 because docs/40 W1's independence argument is
//       worth nothing if a wild store can reach the counter.
//   D2  It only ever counts up, it saturates, and it changes ONLY on a
//       release of the system reset -- so a boot that ends in a reset
//       is counted exactly once, and a system reset held asserted for
//       any number of cycles is still one boot.
//   D3  The power-on boot reads zero. `armed_q` is what makes that
//       true and D3 is what makes it a property rather than a comment:
//       until a second release has happened the counter is zero.
//   D4  THE STRAPS ARE SAMPLED ONCE. Once VALID is set, neither the
//       strap field nor the watchdog-pin field ever changes again,
//       whatever the pins do -- soc_wdog.v W1's "a pin that could
//       disable the watchdog at any moment would be a hardware
//       backdoor", one block across. VALID itself never falls.
//   D5  The report and the epoch change ONLY on a write to their own
//       offset, and a system reset does not touch them: that is what
//       "survives the reset it describes" means, and it is the half of
//       docs/41's power-on-domain argument this block relies on.
//   D6  Nothing in this block is reset by the SYSTEM reset. Stated as
//       the conjunction of D2, D4 and D5 rather than separately,
//       because between them they cover every flip-flop the block has.
//   D7  A well-behaved APB slave: always completes, never errors, and
//       every read is the state it names.
//   D8  BSTAT's two derived flags are exactly the comparisons a loader
//       would otherwise write down a second time.
//
// docs/69 adds two, both about B1:
//
//   D9  THE REPORT IS A RECORD AND NOT A REGISTER. No APB write of any
//       value to any offset changes TMRERR or TMRCNT; TMRERR never
//       falls; TMRCNT never decreases and saturates. It is D1's shape
//       applied to the state B1 added, and it is stated because docs/41
//       section 5.3's rule -- "a record software can erase is a record
//       an upset can erase" -- is a property of the write decode and
//       nothing else checks the write decode exhaustively.
//   D10 THE THREE REPLICAS AGREE, and the voted word is what every read
//       above is written against. THIS IS A REGRESSION STATEMENT AND
//       NOT A REDUNDANCY STATEMENT, and it cannot be one: soc_boot has
//       no port through which a fault can be injected, so in this job
//       the replicas are always in agreement and the voter is proved to
//       be a wire. What it does catch is the failure docs/41 section
//       9.3 describes as silent in the one direction that matters -- a
//       transform that did not round-trip would make one replica
//       permanently present a different value, the voter would mask it,
//       and every other property here would still pass while the
//       triple redundancy had quietly become a duplex. The MASKING
//       theorem, with a fault model, is hw/soc/formal/soc_wdog_tmr.sby,
//       which proves T1-T6 over soc_tmr_bank and tmr_voter at four
//       widths including 22 -- this block's PBANK_W at the shipped
//       parameters -- and `make -C hw/soc/formal boot_tmr_params` is
//       what checks that the composition proved there is the
//       composition instantiated here.
//
// WHAT THEY DO NOT COVER. Nothing here says the straps are CONNECTED to
// anything (sw/tests/test_soc_boot_guards.py does, and the answer is
// that in hardware they are connected to nothing, which is the design);
// nothing says the boot counter counts BOOTS rather than reset releases
// -- the equivalence is soc_top.v's wiring of rst_sys_n and a whole-SoC
// run is the evidence; and THERE IS STILL NO FAULT MODEL OVER THIS
// BLOCK'S OWN STATE IN THIS JOB. B1 makes a claim about what happens
// when a replica is corrupted and this file cannot state it, for
// exactly docs/41 section 9.3's reason. The claim is measured instead,
// by hw/soc/tb/cocotb/test_soc_boot_fi.py, and the redundancy's
// SURVIVAL THROUGH SYNTHESIS -- which no proof can see, docs/43 section
// 9.4 -- is measured a third time by
// sw/tests/test_soc_synthesis_guards.py.
