// Formal properties for the watchdog's protected word: three
// soc_tmr_bank replicas under one tmr_voter, the composition
// hw/soc/rtl/soc_wdog.v builds in its `g_prot_tmr` generate block.
// SymbiYosys harness: hw/soc/formal/soc_wdog_tmr.sby.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE JOB FROM soc_wdog.sby
//
// soc_wdog.sby elaborates the whole watchdog INCLUDING this
// composition, and every property in soc_wdog_props.v is therefore
// already proved over the voted state. That is a regression statement:
// it says the hardening did not change the policy. It is not a
// redundancy statement, and it cannot be one, because soc_wdog has no
// port through which a fault can be injected -- so in that job the
// three replicas are always in agreement and the voter is proved to be
// a wire.
//
// This job adds the only thing that makes a TMR domain a TMR domain: a
// fault model.
//
// WHY THIS IS WORTH A PROOF RATHER THAN A TEST
//
// The failure it catches is silent in the one direction that matters.
// Suppose replica C's storage transform did not round-trip -- a wrong
// rotation in mix_dec, a half-width split that loses a bit, a polarity
// applied on one side only. Then C presents a value the other two do
// not, the voter masks it, and every functional test, every proof in
// soc_wdog.sby and the whole-SoC simulation still pass. What has
// happened is that the watchdog's triple redundancy has quietly become
// a duplex with a permanently wrong third rail: the NEXT upset, in A or
// in B, is no longer masked. The fault-tolerance claim is gone and
// nothing observable has changed. That is exactly the argument
// formal/tmr_voter_cfg_props.v makes for the pilot's configuration
// domain, and soc_tmr_bank is a DIFFERENT module -- no per-bit write
// enable, a different width, and MIX on two replicas rather than one --
// so none of that proof carries over.
//
// WHAT THIS HARNESS COPIES FROM soc_wdog.v, STATED PLAINLY
//
// soc_wdog.v does have an `ifdef FORMAL hook, but a fault model needs
// free inputs at the VOTER, and adding them to the design under an
// `ifdef would put simulation-invisible wiring into the block this
// whole document is about protecting. The composition is rebuilt here
// instead, and three things are therefore copied rather than proven:
// the three POL masks, which replicas carry MIX, and the reset image.
// `make -C hw/soc/formal wdog_tmr_params` reads the masks and the MIX
// assignments back out of hw/soc/rtl/soc_wdog.v and fails if any of
// them has moved; it runs first in the `wdogtmr` target, so the copy
// cannot drift silently.
//
// The WIDTH is deliberately NOT copied. soc_wdog computes PROT_W from
// its own field layout, and reproducing that arithmetic here would be
// copying the thing most likely to change. W is a parameter and the job
// runs at four values instead: 22 (what soc_wdog builds today), 4 (the
// narrowest the MIX guard allows, where the LO/HI split is 2/2 and the
// layer-2 rotation modulus is small enough that an off-by-one in it has
// nowhere to hide), 21 (odd, so LO != HI) and 5 (odd and narrow).
//
// PROVEN (mode prove, k-induction)
//   T1  every replica presents the reference word. f_ref is a plain
//       register written unconditionally from d, which is the semantics
//       soc_wdog.v relies on for its scrub, and it is NOT read out of
//       any bank. qa, qb and qc each equal it at all times. T1 fails if
//       mix_enc and mix_dec are not inverses, if the polarity is
//       applied on one side only, or if the reset image is stored
//       unencoded.
//   T2  and therefore the three replicas agree with each other. Stated
//       separately from T1 because it is the redundancy claim itself:
//       three banks that disagree in the absence of a fault are not a
//       TMR domain, whatever the voter downstream reports.
//   T3  MASKING. Under a fault free in every bit and every cycle,
//       restricted only to one replica at a time -- which is all a
//       bitwise majority claims -- the voted word is still the
//       reference. The fault may move between replicas from one cycle
//       to the next and may corrupt any subset of one replica's bits,
//       which is wider than the single-bit deposits
//       hw/soc/tb/cocotb/test_soc_wdog_fi.py can make.
//   T4  and the disagreement is reported exactly, both directions.
//       soc_wdog.v counts prot_mismatch into WDOGSTAT.TMRCNT, and a
//       flag that also fired on clean cycles would make that count a
//       fiction.
//   T5  the fault-free case on its own, because that is the one the
//       chip runs in.
//   T6  the scrub. One cycle after a fault stops, the replicas agree
//       again -- which is the property the unconditional write exists
//       for and the one that bounds the exposure window to a single
//       cycle. A bank that held its value would satisfy T1 to T5 and
//       fail this.
//
// NOT IN SCOPE, so this file cannot be read as more than it is:
//   * The next-value logic. What soc_wdog.v computes into prot_n is
//     soc_wdog.sby's business, and d is free here.
//   * Two faulty replicas. Nothing about a bitwise majority over three
//     claims anything there, and T3's assumption says so out loud.
//   * The anti-merge argument. POL and MIX exist so that yosys cannot
//     hash the three banks into one, and every property here stays true
//     of a design in which that happened -- setting MIX to 0 on both
//     mixed replicas keeps this whole file passing while destroying the
//     defence. That is sw/tests/test_soc_synthesis_guards.py's job and
//     the two are not substitutes.
//   * Anything about the UNPROTECTED state: counter, reload and pre are
//     outside this composition by decision (soc_wdog.v, W6).
