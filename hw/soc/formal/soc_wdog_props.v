// Formal properties for the watchdog (SymbiYosys harness,
// hw/soc/formal/soc_wdog.sby).
//
// WHERE THESE PROPERTIES COME FROM, which matters more than what they
// say. Every one of them is one of the five requirements W1-W5 stated in
// the header of hw/soc/rtl/soc_wdog.v and argued in
// docs/40-interrupts-timers-watchdog.md section 5. Those requirements
// were written before the RTL, as a policy for what a watchdog has to do
// when the core it watches is protected by nothing else.
//
// THEY ARE SAFETY PROPERTIES, NOT A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION. This file
// does not mirror the counter, the prescaler or the reload. It could
// have -- and then it would be a copy of the design, which this
// repository has twice been bitten by. What it states instead is what
// must never happen, in terms of the escalation outputs and the status
// register as they are seen from outside:
//
//   * the enable never reads back as clear on an armed part (W1);
//   * a write without the key never changes an escalation output (W5);
//   * stage 2 is never reached except out of stage 1 (W3);
//   * stage 3 is never reached before the ESCALATE-th stage 2 (W3);
//   * the record of what happened is never lost or reduced (W4).
//
// The one place a ghost mirrors design state is the reset counter, and
// it has to: "the pin follows the count" is not sayable without a count.
// It is reconstructed from rst_req_o's own rising edges, so it is a
// count of the OUTPUT and not a copy of the register.
//
// WHAT IS NOT PROVEN HERE:
//
//   * Liveness of any kind. Nothing below says the watchdog ever fires.
//     A block whose counter never reached zero satisfies every property
//     in this file, which is why the cover task is not optional and why
//     hw/soc/tb/cocotb/test_soc_wdog.py measures the timeout in clocks.
//   * The timeout ARITHMETIC. That (reload + 1) * PRESCALE clocks elapse
//     between a kick and stage 1 is a measurement, not a proof; it is
//     test_the_timeout_is_reload_plus_one_prescaler_periods.
//   * Anything about the register OFFSETS. This block has a one-hot
//     register port; which APB offsets soc_gptimer.v maps onto it is
//     that block's suite.
//   * Anything about what the core does with nmi_o, or about the system
//     reset rst_req_o drives. Both are outside this module.
//   * Reset behaviour beyond the initial state.
//
// W7 AND W8, added by docs/43-core-hardening.md, are stated at the end
// of this file. The most important of them is W7b: at the reset
// configuration -- WINS = 0 and the kick budget disarmed -- neither
// mechanism can fire, so the block IS the watchdog docs/40 built and
// docs/42 measured. Everything above continues to hold unchanged, and
// that is the regression statement rather than a new claim.
