"""Toggle-rate extraction from a whole-SoC VCD, for activity-annotated power.

    vcd_activity.py <vcd> --clock tb_soc.dut.clk_i --scope tb_soc.dut \
                    --window name:first:last [--window ...] \
                    --json out.json

WHAT THIS MEASURES AND WHY IT IS NOT A SAIF.

`docs/47`'s sign-off `report_power` runs with no activity annotation at
all: OpenSTA's default is that every top-level input and every register
output toggles 0.1 times per clock period at a 50 % duty cycle, and
everything combinational is propagated from those.  `docs/53` section
7.1 item 3 labelled the resulting number "an estimate wearing a
measurement's clothes".  This script replaces the 0.1 with a number the
design actually produced.

It cannot produce a SAIF, and the reason is a property of the netlist
rather than a choice made here: `hw/soc/flow/syn_soc_top.sh` runs
`synth -flatten` and `abc`, so of 33,832 nets in
`hw/soc/pnr/runs/full3/final/nl/soc_top.nl.v` only 617 carry a name a
simulation could match, and not one flip-flop instance does.  A VCD
therefore cannot be matched to that netlist pin by pin.  What CAN be
matched is:

  * the three top-level ports, by name;
  * the six SRAM macro instances, by name -- they are the only named
    cells in the netlist, and their control pins are what the macro
    Liberty's `when` conditions switch on;
  * the population statistic that OpenSTA's 0.1 is a stand-in for --
    the mean toggle rate of the design's registers.

So this script reports, per window: the per-port activity and duty, the
per-macro control-pin activity and duty derived from the behavioural
memory's own ports, and the mean activity and duty of every register in
the design, together with the per-block breakdown of the same.

REGISTERS ARE IDENTIFIED BY BEHAVIOUR, NOT BY DECLARATION.  A bit is
counted as a register output if every one of its transitions inside the
window falls on a rising edge of the clock.  A `reg` in an `always @(*)`
block is therefore not counted as one, and a `wire` driven by a
flip-flop through nothing but a rename is.  The alternative -- trusting
the VCD's `$var reg` versus `$var wire` -- is a statement about Verilog
declarations and not about the design.

WHAT IT DOES NOT MEASURE.  Glitches: this is an RTL simulation with no
delays, so a combinational node that would glitch three times in silicon
transitions once here.  Every combinational figure below is therefore a
lower bound, and it is one reason section "what this does not cover" in
the accompanying document refuses to call any of this a silicon
measurement.
