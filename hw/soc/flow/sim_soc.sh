# escalation ladder, three boots of the SoC in one simulation. See

# Sources: hw/soc/rtl/soc_*.v (this project's), hw/soc/gen/*.v (the
# sv2v-converted Ibex, exactly as sim_ibex.sh reads it) and
# hw/soc/tb/tb_soc.v. The RTL read here is the sv2v output, not the
# SystemVerilog, for the reason docs/38 gives: Icarus is this project's
# simulator.
#
# The UART divider is defined ONCE, here, and given to both the compiler
# and the simulator. The program writes it into the scaler register and
# the testbench's serial decoder assumes it; if the two disagreed the run
# would show framing errors rather than a clear message, so they are not
# allowed to disagree.

#
# It is a GENERATED `defparam` IN A SECOND ROOT MODULE and not a source
# edit, because the parameter is on an instance four levels down inside
# ibex_top and this flow's whole discipline is that nothing under
# hw/soc/ext or hw/soc/gen is modified to change the design.

# `iverilog -Ptb_soc.dut.u_ibex.gen_regfile_ff.register_file_i.SYNPRE=1`
# ELABORATES, EXITS 0, PRINTS NOTHING AND CHANGES NOTHING: Icarus's -P
# reaches root modules only, and a hierarchical path that names no root
# is discarded in silence. It was measured on a four-module toy --
# `-P` leaves the parameter at 0, the defparam below sets it -- and
# docs/49 section 8 records it, because a knob that looks applied and is
# not is exactly the shape docs/41 section 6.6 counts. The check after

#
# IT MOVES THE CYCLE COUNT, and that is the whole point of running it
# here. One extra cycle of read latency on the RAM and the boot ROM makes
# the whole-SoC run NOT cycle-identical, and it is not supposed to be:
# docs/50 reports the new count, its breakdown between the two memories
# and the fact that all 22 checks still pass and the escalation demo
# still runs.
#
# SOC_RAM_RDREG and SOC_ROM_RDREG are the ATTRIBUTION knobs and default
# to SOC_MEM_RDREG. They defparam the two soc_mem instances individually
# rather than soc_top's parameter, which is what lets docs/50 section 5
# split the cycle cost between instruction fetch and load/store instead
# of reporting one number for both. Setting them differently is a
# measurement configuration and not a design: nothing ships that way, and

# design -- and reaches soc_top's MEM_HARDEN by the same generated
# defparam as the knobs above, with the same arm check afterwards:
# soc_mem.v's g_ecc and g_plain are the two arms and exactly one exists.
#
