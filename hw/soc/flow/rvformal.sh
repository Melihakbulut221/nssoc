#   flow/rvformal.sh setup                 build the work tree and

#
# Environment:
#   IBEX_REGFILE  upstream (DEFAULT HERE) or secded. docs/63 phase 1 is
#                 the stock core; phase 2 is the substituted register
#                 file of docs/43 section 6 and the delta between the
#                 two runs is the measurement. The default is the
#                 opposite of the SoC flows' default ON PURPOSE, and
#                 hw/soc/flow/ibex_sources.sh explains why the two
#                 families of flow default differently.
#   RVF_OUT       work tree. Default hw/soc/out/rvformal-$IBEX_REGFILE,
#                 so the two phases cannot overwrite each other's
#                 evidence.
#   RVF_JOBS      -j for the check makefile. Default: nproc.
#   RVF_SOLVER    solver/engine for every check. Default boolector,
#                 which is what every number in docs/63 Parts 1 and 2
#                 was produced with. Any name genchecks.py understands:
#                 boolector, bitwuzla, yices, z3, cvc5, btormc, bmc3.
#   RVF_INSN_FIX  0 (default) uses riscv-formal's instruction models
#                 exactly as fetched. 1 substitutes the two corrected
#                 copies in hw/soc/rvformal/insns/ for `div` and `rem`,
#                 whose upstream versions compute an UNSIGNED result --
#                 docs/63 section 7.5, which is a defect in the
#                 specification and not in the core.
#   RVF_LIVENESS_DEPTH
#                 check cycle for the `liveness` check only. Default 50,
#                 which is what docs/63 section 8 reports. It is
#                 overridable and nothing else is, because the
#                 instruction after a given one can be a 37-cycle
#                 divide and closing that costs a deeper unrolling than
#                 the rest of the set put together.
#
# WHY A WORK TREE AND NOT A DIRECTORY IN THE CHECKOUT
#
# riscv-formal's checks/genchecks.py derives its base directory as
# `cwd/../..` and its core name as the last path component of cwd, so
# the configuration it reads MUST sit two levels below a directory that
# also contains checks/ and insns/. Upstream's own cores live in
# <riscv-formal>/cores/<name>/. Putting ours there would make
# hw/soc/ext/riscv-formal a checkout with our files in it, and the rule
# hw/soc/tools.soc.mk applies to every fetched thing -- pinned, verified,
# gitignored, never vendored, `git status` clean -- would stop being
# true of it, exactly as docs/38 section 4.2 insists it stays true of
# hw/soc/ext/ibex.
#
# So the layout genchecks needs is BUILT, out of symlinks to the pristine
# checkout plus copies of the two tracked files:
#
#   $RVF_OUT/checks  -> ext/riscv-formal/checks     (symlink)
#   $RVF_OUT/insns   -> ext/riscv-formal/insns      (symlink)
#   $RVF_OUT/cores/ibex/wrapper.sv                  (copy of the tracked)
#   $RVF_OUT/cores/ibex/{checks,cover}.cfg          (expanded from .in)
#
# Everything under $RVF_OUT is generated and gitignored. The tracked
# sources are hw/soc/rvformal/ and this file.
