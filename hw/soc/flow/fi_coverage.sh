# Census the core's flip-flops, and say which of them the campaign's
# site list reaches.
#
#   fi_coverage.sh [out_dir]
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.  `hw/soc/fi/targets.py` is a list a person wrote, and
# a list a person wrote is a list a person can leave something off.  The
# way a structure comes to be unmeasured in this repository has twice
# been an omission rather than a decision -- docs/41 section 8 says so
# in the test that checks its own target list is complete -- and the
# campaign's own honesty checks cannot catch that class: they verify
# that every site it names elaborates, not that every flip-flop that
# elaborates is named.
#
# So this asks the other question.  Yosys elaborates `ibex_top` at
# soc_top.v's exact parameters, flattens it, and reports every
# flip-flop that survives, by the name of the signal it stores.  The
# Python at the end attributes each one to a campaign site, or reports
# it as uncovered.  What comes out is a coverage figure and, more
# usefully, the list of what is NOT in the campaign -- which docs/42
# section 9 quotes rather than paraphrases.
#
# It is a census of the RTL, not of the netlist.  Synthesis may merge,
# duplicate or delete flip-flops after this point; docs/38 section 8.4
# counts 2,106 in the mapped `small-pmp` netlist and section 4.2 of
# docs/42 is where the two numbers are put side by side.
