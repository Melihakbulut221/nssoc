"""Does a clock gate change anything? Two whole-SoC dumps, cycle by cycle.

    clkgate_check.py equiv  <base.vcd> <gated.vcd> --clock <path>
                            --scope <path> [--scope ...] [--exclude <path>]
    clkgate_check.py duty   <gated.vcd> --clock <path>
                            --enable <path> [--enable ...]

WHY THIS EXISTS, and what it is a substitute for.

`hw/soc/formal/soc_bus_props.v` F10 proves that the fabric's clock-gate
enable is COMPLETE: in every cycle where it is low, no register in
`soc_bus` changes value.  That is a theorem, it is proved by k-induction,
and every one of its five terms is load-bearing under mutation.  It is
what licenses `soc_top.v` to replace the fabric's clock with a gated one
without restating F1 to F9.

NO SUCH PROOF IS AVAILABLE FOR THE ACCELERATOR.  `soc_npu.v`'s enable has
to cover 2,152 flip-flops inside `hw/rtl/pilot_top.v`, which
`docs/34-pilot-freeze.md` pins by blob hash for the TTIHP26b shuttle:
the die's internals cannot be modified, its property set is `formal/` and
is not this work's to extend, and the only thing reachable from outside
it is its clock.  So the statement that the gate changes nothing is made
by MEASUREMENT instead, and this is the instrument:

    the same program, on the same design, built twice -- once with
    CLKGATE = 0 and once with CLKGATE = 1 -- and every signal under the
    gated scope compared at every clock edge of the whole run.

A difference of one bit in one cycle is a failure.  Zero differences over
N cycles is not a proof and this script does not call it one: it is the
statement that the enable is complete ON THE WORKLOADS MEASURED, which is
what `soc_npu.v`'s `wake_hold` counter exists to put margin around.

WHAT IS COMPARED.  Every VCD identifier whose path lies at or under a
`--scope`, by PATH and not by identifier -- the two dumps assign
identifiers independently and a gated build has signals an ungated one
does not.  A path present in only one dump is reported and not compared;
the count of such paths is part of the result, because a comparison that
silently skipped the interesting half would report success.

WHEN IT IS COMPARED.  At every rising edge of `--clock`, AFTER the whole
timestamp has been applied.  A VCD orders the changes inside a timestamp
by identifier rather than by cause, so a per-line comparison would be a
comparison of dump-identifier sort order; buffering the timestamp removes
the question.  This is the same rule `hw/soc/flow/vcd_activity.py` states
for the same reason.

The `duty` mode reports, per enable signal, the fraction of cycles it was
LOW -- which is the fraction of clock edges the gate removed, and is the
number the power measurement is a consequence of.
