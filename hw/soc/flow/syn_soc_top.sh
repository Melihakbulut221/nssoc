# Synthesise soc_top -- the WHOLE SoC, core included -- onto ihp-sg13g2.
#
#   syn_soc_top.sh [clock_period_ns] [out_dir]
#
# docs/41 section 10 item 7 and docs/43 section 11 both recorded that
# `soc_top.v` had never been synthesised as one design, and docs/44
# section 10's last line repeated it. Every area and timing number under
# hw/soc/ before this script was per-block: flow/syn_ibex.sh measures
# `ibex_top` standalone and flow/syn_soc.sh measures one peripheral at a
# time, with soc_top.v excluded from its source list on purpose. This
# script is the missing one.
#
# THE RECIPE IS THE SAME RECIPE. Same liberty, same typical corner, same
# abc.constr (sg13g2_buf_4 driving, 5 fF load), same `-D` delay target,
# same deferred flatten, same `stat -liberty`. That is the whole point:
# a whole-design number measured a different way could not be compared
# with the per-block numbers it is supposed to compose from.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE MEMORIES, WHICH ARE THE ONE THING THAT CANNOT BE SYNTHESISED
#
# hw/soc/rtl/soc_mem.v says of itself, in its first paragraph, that it is
# "a BEHAVIOURAL MODEL of a memory, not a memory": it infers a register
# array. soc_top.v instantiates it twice, at sizes the generated map
# fixes -- 64 KiB of RAM and 8 KiB of boot ROM, which is 16,384 and 2,048
# 32-bit words. Elaborated as one design those two arrays are 589,824
# flip-flops, against 2,328 in the whole of Ibex. Synthesising them would
# not be slow-but-honest; it would be a measurement of a simulation
# model. flow/syn_soc.sh already excludes soc_mem.v from its source list
# for exactly this reason and says so.
#
# So the memory boundary is cut, and SOC_MEM says how:
#
#   stub       (default) The two instances are replaced by a MACRO
#              STAND-IN generated into the output directory. It keeps
#              soc_mem's ports and its protocol timing -- gnt_o = req_i
#              combinationally, rvalid_o and err_o registered -- and
#              replaces the array with one row plus input capture
#              registers, so that every path from the fabric into a
#              memory still ENDS at a flip-flop and every path out of one
#              still STARTS at a flip-flop. That is the first-order
#              timing model of an SRAM macro and it is what makes the
#              netlist readable by OpenSTA with no macro liberty.
#
#              IT IS NOT FUNCTIONAL. rdata_o is not the memory's
#              contents. This netlist is for area and timing and must
#              never be simulated or compared against one that is.
#
#   blackbox   The two instances are left as unresolved blackboxes. The
#              area report is then the SoC's standard-cell logic and
#              nothing else, with no stand-in contaminating it. This is
#              the cleanest AREA number and it cannot be timed: OpenSTA
#              has no liberty for the macro.
#
#   array      The real soc_mem.v, all 589,824 registers. Provided so the
#              claim above is falsifiable rather than asserted. It is run
#              only with SOC_ELAB_ONLY=1, which cuts the script after
#              `hierarchy -check`: that is docs/45 section 5's
#              elaboration measurement, and it is the only thing this
#              mode is used for. No area or timing number in docs/45
#              comes from it.
#
#   sram       THE REAL MEMORIES, added by docs/47. hw/soc/rtl/
#              soc_mem_sram.v declares a module called `soc_mem` built
#              on six RM_IHPSG13 SRAM macros -- four
#              RM_IHPSG13_1P_2048x64_c2_bm_bist for the 64 KiB RAM and
#              two RM_IHPSG13_1P_1024x32_c2_bm_bist for the 8 KiB boot
#              ROM. The macros are read as blackbox DECLARATIONS out of
#              hw/soc/pnr/, so `stat -liberty` reports the SoC's
#              standard-cell logic and the macro area is added from the
#              LEF separately; docs/47 section 4 does that addition in
#              public rather than folding it into one number.
#
#              UNLIKE `stub`, THIS ONE CAN BE TIMED PROPERLY. The PDK
#              ships Liberty for these macros at all three corners, so
#              flow/sta_soc_top.sh reads them when SOC_MEM=sram and the
#              read arc it charges -- 9.2941 ns at slow_1p08V_125C on
#              the 2048x64 part -- is the quantity docs/45 section 8
#              named as the thing the stub could not bound.
#
#              It is the netlist hw/soc/pnr/ hardens, and it MUST NOT BE
#              SIMULATED: the macros are blackboxes here and the ROM has
#              no contents.
#
# In `stub` mode the stand-in is held as a hierarchy boundary across
# synthesis so `stat -liberty` reports its area separately and the SoC's
# logic area can be had by subtraction, in the same run that produced the
# netlist STA reads. The boundary is released before the final flatten,
# by flow/syn_soc.sh's own argument about deferred flatten.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# IBEX_REGFILE and IBEX_FAULT_PORT default to the design AS SHIPPED --
# `secded` and `1` -- and not to flow/syn_ibex.sh's `upstream` / `0`.
# The difference is deliberate and is flow/ibex_sources.sh's rule: the
# SoC flows build the design as it would ship, the standalone
# measurement flows reproduce a published number unless asked otherwise.
# soc_top.v connects rf_ecc_err_o unconditionally, so IBEX_FAULT_PORT=0
# here fails at elaboration with the port's name in the message.
#
# IBEX_RF_SYNPRE=1 hoists the register file's syndrome tree past the read
# multiplexer -- hw/soc/rtl/ibex_regfile_secded.v's SYNPRE, one parity
# tree per register. It DEFAULTS TO 0 and nothing sets it; the same rule
# flow/syn_ibex.sh states for the same parameter applies here, and
# sw/tests/test_soc_regfile_guards.py enforces it. docs/44 section 5.5
# priced it on the register file alone and docs/49 measures it through
# place-and-route, which is the only reason this knob exists on the
# whole-SoC flow at all.
#
# SOC_MEM_RDREG=1 is soc_top.v's MEM_RDREG, docs/50's knob: one register
# stage on the RAM's and the boot ROM's read return, which in
# SOC_MEM=sram means one flip-flop bank between the SRAM macros' A_DOUT
# multiplexer and everything downstream of it. IT DEFAULTS TO 0 and at 0
# nothing is emitted, so the script takes the path it took before the
# knob existed; the control is that the netlist is then byte-identical to
# the one docs/47 hardened, and docs/50 section 2 measures that it is.
#
# THE CHPARAM IS ON soc_top AND NOT ON soc_mem, deliberately. In
# SOC_MEM=stub and SOC_MEM=blackbox the module called `soc_mem` is a
# generated stand-in, and a chparam on a module that does not declare the
# parameter is an error rather than a no-op. Going through soc_top's own
# parameter means the four `soc_mem` implementations -- the behavioural
# model, the SRAM build, the stand-in and the blackbox -- all have to
# declare RDREG, which is a compile-time check that they agree on the
# boundary. sw/tests/test_soc_synthesis_guards.py checks the port lists;
# this checks the parameter.

# ---- THE ACCELERATOR, WHICH WAS MISSING ------------------------------
#
# docs/51 put `u_npu` inside soc_top.v and this list was not updated, so
# from that commit until docs/61 this script did not elaborate at all:
#
#   ERROR: Module `\soc_npu' referenced in module `\soc_top' in cell
#          `\u_npu' is not part of the design.
#
# docs/57 section 3.2 found it and docs/59 section 7 found it again from
# the DEF. Everything docs/45, 47, 48, 49, 50 and 53 measure is a
# `soc_top` that this script could still build when they were written and
# that no longer exists: 27,565 cells against 41,543, 3,085 flip-flops
# against 5,237.
#
# THERE IS NO KNOB HERE AND THERE CANNOT BE ONE. soc_top.v instantiates
# u_npu unconditionally, so "without the NPU" is not a configuration of
# this design -- it is a different design, and the only artefact of it is
# the netlist already on disk at hw/soc/out/s47-sram/soc_top.netlist.v.
# A SOC_NPU=0 mode would not reproduce that netlist; it would fail to
# elaborate, exactly as this script did before this block was added.
#
# soc_npu.v instantiates hw/rtl/pilot_top.v -- the FROZEN pilot, docs/34
# -- rather than copying it, so pilot_top.v, lif_core.v, aer_fifo.v and
# scrub.v are READ out of hw/rtl/ and never modified, exactly as
# flow/sim_soc.sh reads them. The include path is needed for both
# directions: soc_npu.v includes rtl/soc_npu_regs.vh and pilot_top.v
# includes hw/rtl/npu_regs.vh.
#
# secded_enc.v and secded_dec.v have TWO consumers -- the register-file
# codec at IBEX_REGFILE=secded and lif_core's weight-word ECC -- and a
# module declared twice is an error. ibex_sources() supplies them in the
# secded configuration, so this list supplies them only in the other one.

# ---- SOC_KEEP_HIER, a DIAGNOSTIC and not the measurement -------------
#
# With SOC_KEEP_HIER=1 the direct children of soc_top -- the core, the
# fabric, the bridge and the peripherals -- are held as hierarchy
# boundaries. `flatten` skips a module carrying keep_hierarchy, so each
# child is still flattened INTERNALLY and only the top-level boundaries
# survive. Two things become measurable that the flattened build cannot
# show: `stat -liberty` reports each block's area inside the integrated
# design, and OpenSTA's path reports carry hierarchical instance names,
# so a critical path can be attributed to a block rather than inferred
# from whichever nets happened to keep a public name.
#
# IT IS A DIFFERENT NETLIST AND ITS SLACK IS NOT THE HEADLINE. A kept
# boundary blocks constant propagation across it, and soc_top.v drives
# `cheriot_enable_i` with a constant -- docs/44 section 5.1's whole
# subject. In this mode that constant stops at the port and the CHERIoT
# logic comes back, so the design it times is not the design the flatten
# builds. Both are run and docs/45 quotes both, labelled.
