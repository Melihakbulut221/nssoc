# Build everything the NPU-connection fault-injection campaign of docs/52
# needs, and elaborate it ONCE.
#
#   fi_npu.sh [out_dir]
#
# The campaign runs hundreds of simulations of the same design with
# different plusargs, so elaboration is hoisted out of the loop: this
# script produces one `tb_soc_npu_fi.vvp` and `hw/soc/fi/npu_campaign.py`
# invokes `vvp` on it with +site, +bit, +cycle, +armed and +budget.  That
# is why the injection site is a runtime argument and a case statement
# rather than a compile-time define -- an elaboration per injection would
# cost more than the simulations do.  hw/soc/flow/fi_core.sh's header
# makes the same argument and this file is its sibling.
#
# SOURCES ARE EXACTLY sim_soc.sh's.  This project's hw/soc/rtl/soc_*.v,
# the sv2v-converted Ibex in hw/soc/gen/, and SEVEN FILES READ OUT OF THE
# FROZEN hw/rtl/ AND NEVER WRITTEN: pilot_top.v, lif_core.v, aer_fifo.v,
# scrub.v, secded_enc.v, secded_dec.v and tmr_voter.v, plus npu_regs.vh
# through an include path.  docs/34 pins those by git blob hash and the
# TTIHP26b shuttle closes 2026-09-21; docs/51 section 16 lists them.
#
# THE DIE IS INSIDE THE DESIGN UNDER TEST AND THAT IS THE POINT.  The
# campaign injects into the connection AND into the die's own half of the
# serial transport, and hw/soc/fi/npu_targets.py keeps the two in
# separate strata because they lead to different decisions: one is a
# design still open and the other is silicon already committed.

# hw/soc/tb/cocotb/Makefile.soc_npu exposes.
#
# THIS CAMPAIGN USES IT FOR A COUNTERFACTUAL AND NOT FOR A MUTATION.
# "The protection works" is not a measurement unless the same experiment
# on the design WITHOUT it produces a different number -- docs/41
# section 8.3 -- and the connection has exactly one recovery mechanism of
# its own: the bounded wait on an injection-queue fetch, which expires,
# returns the engine to idle and latches IRQ_CAUSE.FETCH_ER. It is not a
# parameter that can be turned off (FETCH_MAX is constrained to 1..15),
# so the counterfactual is a copy of soc_npu.v with the expiry term
# removed, replayed against the records where the bound actually fired.
# docs/52 section 6.5.
#
# The substituted file is NOT in the source tree and the campaign log
# carries the tag, because a build that is not the design of record must
# not be able to write a records.csv that looks like one.
