# Find the fastest clock a configuration closes SETUP at, at every
# sg13g2 corner, with the pilot's 5% derate.
#
#   sweep_ibex.sh <config> [lo_ns] [hi_ns] [steps] [gate]
#
#   gate = setup_all   (default) setup over every path group
#          setup_sync            setup over the clk_i path group only
#
# Method: bisection on the clock period. Each probe RE-SYNTHESISES at
# that period -- ABC is given the same number the SDC then checks -- so
# what is measured is "the design closes at P", not "a netlist optimised
# for 20 ns happens to have positive slack at P". Those are different
# claims and only the first is a frequency.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT COVER, STATED HERE AND ON EVERY LINE IT PRINTS.
#
# HOLD IS NOT IN THE GATE. On a synthesis netlist there is no placement,
# no routing, no clock tree and no hold-fixing buffer, and the SDC
# charges 0.25 ns of clock uncertainty against the hold check as a
# stand-in for skew that has not been built yet. Hold therefore fails at
# the fast corner at every period, by an amount that does not vary with
# the period, and gating on it would return "closes nowhere" for every
# configuration -- a statement about the stage, not about the design.
# The pilot closes hold in place-and-route (PL_RESIZER_HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN
# 0.1, GRT_RESIZER_HOLD_SLACK_MARGIN 0.05 in
# hw/openlane/pilot_ihp/config.signoff-6x2.json), which is where it is
# closable. So hold is carried as an obligation on the next stage, and
# every line below prints it rather than dropping it.
#
# This is a deliberate narrowing, so it is named: the summary line says
# "closes SETUP", never "closes". docs/28 section 4.4a is what an
# unnamed narrowing costs.
