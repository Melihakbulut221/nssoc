# Census the NPU connection's flip-flops, and say which of them the
# campaign's site list reaches.
#
#   fi_npu_coverage.sh [out_dir]
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.  `hw/soc/fi/npu_targets.py` is a list a person wrote,
# and a list a person wrote is a list a person can leave something off.
# The campaign's own honesty checks cannot catch that class: control 1
# verifies that every site it NAMES elaborates, which is the opposite
# question from whether every flip-flop that elaborates is NAMED.
#
# docs/42 section 4.2 records what asking the second question found on
# the core: three whole structures missing, 128 flip-flops of debug CSRs
# among them, and a naming difference between two tools.  None of it was
# reachable from inside the campaign.  hw/soc/flow/fi_coverage.sh is this
# file's sibling and this one follows it exactly.
#
# TWO CENSUSES, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO DESIGNS IN THE DUT.
#
#   the connection  soc_npu with `pilot_top` BLACK-BOXED, which is the
#                   same scope docs/51 section 11 measured at 717
#                   flip-flops.  This is the coverage figure.
#   the frozen die  pilot_top alone, at soc_npu.v's parameters.  This is
#                   NOT a coverage figure and hw/soc/fi/npu_coverage.py
#                   says so where it prints it: `die_ser` is one stratum
#                   over the die's serial front end, and docs/16 is the
#                   campaign that measured the whole block.
#
# It is a census of the RTL, not of the netlist.  Synthesis may merge,
# duplicate or delete flip-flops after this point, and the script reports
# the sites this campaign injects into that `opt_clean` removes -- which
# is one concrete way an RTL campaign and a gate-level campaign would
# differ here.  docs/32 is what closing that gap looked like for the die.

# `attrmap -modattr -remove keep_hierarchy` before `flatten` is load

# banks, its parity bank and its rd_valid rails as one of its two
# anti-merge defences, so without this line `flatten` skips all of them
# and the census misses 58 flip-flops per queue while reporting a clean
# total.  hw/soc/flow/syn_soc.sh's own comment records the same trap
# costing the hardened watchdog a wrong area number.
#
# `memory_map` is here for the same reason at a different scale: without
# it aer_fifo's `mem` stays a $mem cell and the 256 bits of queue storage
# -- which is the largest single structure in this campaign -- would be
# reported as covered by nothing because they would not be flip-flops.
