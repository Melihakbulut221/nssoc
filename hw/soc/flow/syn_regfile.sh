# Measure the architectural register file on its own, five ways.
#
#   syn_regfile.sh [out_dir]
#
# WHY A SEPARATE SCRIPT AND WHY FOUR CONFIGURATIONS
#
# docs/41 section 6.5 records a measurement defect worth not repeating:
# the cost of a hardening was very nearly quoted against the number the
# PREVIOUS document had measured, which would have credited the
# hardening with a saving that a refactor in the same commit had made.
# The rule that came out of it is that the baseline has to be the same
# source, measured now, with only the thing being priced turned off.
#
# For a register file substituted into Ibex there are two candidate
# baselines and they are not the same:
#
#   upstream   hw/soc/gen/ibex_register_file_ff.v, the sv2v output of
#              the pinned Ibex. This is what the design contained
#              before docs/43 and what docs/38's 275,682.6198 um2
#              includes.
#   harden0    hw/soc/rtl/ibex_regfile_secded.v with HARDEN = 0. Same
#              file as the hardened build, same generate structure,
#              protection switched off.
#
# The difference between those two is THIS PROJECT'S REWRITE of a file
# it did not write, and it is not part of the cost of the protection.
# The difference between `harden0` and `harden1` is. Both are reported,
# and docs/43 section 7 quotes the second and names the first.
#
# `scrub0` is the third: correction on read with the walking write-back
# removed, so that what the scrub costs is separable from what the code
# costs.
#
# `slowcorr` is the fifth and it is docs/44's: HARDEN = 1 with
# FASTCORR = 0, which is the read path docs/43 shipped -- the frozen
# decoder's own `data_out`, its 64-wide OR, its subtract and its
# multiplexer. `harden1` is the same file with FASTCORR = 1. The pair is
# what prices docs/44 section 5's timing recovery in area, and the sign
# of the difference is not assumed in advance: replacing a multiplexer
# with thirty-two comparators can cost area as easily as save it.
#
# The recipe is syn_soc.sh's, which is syn_ibex.sh's: same liberty, same
# corner, same abc constraint file, same 20 ns delay target.
