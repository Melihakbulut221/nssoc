# Multi-corner OpenSTA on the WHOLE-DESIGN soc_top netlist.
#
#   sta_soc_top.sh <period_ns> [out_dir]
#
# Reads <out_dir>/soc_top.sta.v, which flow/syn_soc_top.sh wrote with
# -noexpr -nohex -nodec and splitnets, and reports setup and hold at all
# three sg13g2 corners with the pilot's 5 % derate applied as a float.
#
# THREE THINGS ARE SHARED WITH flow/sta_ibex.sh ON PURPOSE, because a
# whole-design number measured under a different constraint set could
# not be compared with the per-block numbers docs/38, docs/43 and
# docs/44 quote:
#
#   sta/ibex.sdc.in        the constraint set. Its name says `ibex` and
#                          its content is LibreLane's base.sdc with the
#                          ihp-sg13g2 defaults substituted in: a clock on
#                          clk_i, 20 % IO delay on every other port, a
#                          sg13g2_buf_4 driver, 6 fF of load, 0.25 ns of
#                          uncertainty, 0.15 ns of transition, ideal
#                          clocks and a 5 % derate written as a float.
#                          Nothing in it names an Ibex port. It is used
#                          here unedited.
#   sta/ibex_sta.tcl.in    the per-corner script, with @TOP@ = soc_top.
#   flow/sta_verdict.awk   the verdict rule, which is therefore one rule
#                          and not two copies of one.
#
# NO TIE-OFF FILE, and that is the point of the exercise rather than an
# omission. sta/ibex_tieoffs.sdc exists because flow/sta_ibex.sh times
# `ibex_top` standalone, where `cheriot_enable_i` is a free primary input
# that soc_top.v in fact drives with a constant -- docs/44 section 5.1.
# At this level that input is not a port at all; the constant is inside
# the design and the synthesiser has already propagated it. There is
# nothing left to case-analyse.
#
# WHAT THIS FLOW CANNOT SEE, stated here and not only in the document:
# the netlist it reads has the memory macro stand-in of
# flow/syn_soc_top.sh at the two memory boundaries, so every path into or
# out of a memory is bounded by a standard-cell flip-flop and not by an
# SRAM macro's setup and clock-to-Q. And, as everywhere else under
# hw/soc/, there is no placement, no routing, no clock tree and no
# resizer.
