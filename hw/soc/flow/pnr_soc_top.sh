# docs/45 section 9 item 1: "Until something is placed, the honest
# summary of this document is 'it synthesises, and the number that
# decides the part is not a synthesis number'." This is the script that
# places it. docs/47 is the run.
#
# =====================================================================
# THE PILOT IS FROZEN AND THIS SCRIPT CANNOT TOUCH IT
# =====================================================================
#
# docs/34 pins the TTIHP26b submission by git blob hash and the shuttle
# closes 2026-09-21. hw/openlane/ -- run_trial.sh, pilot_ihp/,
# sram_pilot/, aer_fifo/ and all 36 of their run directories -- is READ
# by this script and never written. Three things follow and all three
# are enforced rather than intended:
#
#   * the config lives in hw/soc/pnr/, not hw/openlane/;
#   * the run directories are hw/soc/pnr/runs/<tag>, gitignored, named
#     by --run-tag so LibreLane cannot pick one for itself;
#   * this script refuses to run if its config directory would land
#     inside hw/openlane/.
#
# The settings this config takes from hw/openlane/sram_pilot and
# hw/openlane/pilot_ihp are COPIED with their reasons restated, and
# hw/soc/pnr/pdn_macro.tcl is a new file with the same content as the
# pilot's rather than a reference to it, so nothing here depends on a
# frozen file staying where it is.
#
# =====================================================================
# THE TOOLCHAIN IS THE PILOT'S, ROOTLESS, AND IT IS ASSERTED
# =====================================================================
#
# Same discipline hw/openlane/run_trial.sh established in docs/12: no
# docker, no root, no system package install. Per-tool shim wrappers in
# ~/.local/opt/llbin that each set their own LD_LIBRARY_PATH (the
# OpenROAD build ships a newer glibc that segfaults host binaries if it
# leaks into the ambient environment), a LibreLane virtualenv, and an
# oss-cad-suite checkout for Yosys.
#
# Two traps this script asserts against rather than hoping about:
#
#   1. --pdk MUST be on the command line. LibreLane's ciel wrapper
#      resolves and installs the PDK from the CLI option (default
#      sky130A) BEFORE config.json is read, so "PDK": "ihp-sg13g2" in
#      the config is then looked up inside the sky130 tree and the run
#      dies with "PDK not found".
#   2. A STALE ENABLED PDK DOES NOT ANNOUNCE ITSELF. ciel exposes one
#      version through the $PDK_ROOT/<pdk> symlink and everything
#      resolves through it, so hardening against a PDK the tool was
#      never tested on looks exactly like hardening against the right
#      one. The pin is read out of the installed wheel's
#      pdk_hashes.yaml, not hard-coded here, and compared.
#
# =====================================================================
# WHY VERILOG_FILES IS NOT IN config.json
# =====================================================================
#
# The source list is about forty paths and its composition is a
# DECISION: flow/ibex_sources.sh chooses hw/soc/rtl/ibex_regfile_secded.v
# over hw/soc/gen/ibex_register_file_ff.v at IBEX_REGFILE=secded, and
# hw/soc/genp/ibex_top.v over hw/soc/gen/ibex_top.v at
# IBEX_FAULT_PORT=1, and exactly one of each pair may be in the list.
# Duplicating that logic in JSON would create a second place that has
# to agree with flow/syn_soc_top.sh and that nothing compares -- which
# is the defect docs/44 section 5.4 and docs/45 section 4.1 both refuse
# one level up.
#
# So this script merges the list into a RESOLVED COPY of config.json in
# the run directory, and then ASSERTS that VERILOG_FILES is the only key
# it added or changed. docs/34 section 8.5's trap was a generator that
# silently deleted a hand-added fix from a config; the assertion is what
# stops this one from being able to. The resolved config is written
# beside config.json, because LibreLane resolves `dir::` and the run
# directory relative to the config file it is handed.
