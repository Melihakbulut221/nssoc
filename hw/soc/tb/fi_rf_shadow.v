// The register file's correction report, recomputed from storage.
//
// hw/soc/rtl/ibex_regfile_secded.v counts the cycles in which any of its
// three decoders -- read port a, read port b, the scrub -- saw a
// correctable syndrome, in `sec_cycles`, and the uncorrectable ones in
// `ded_cycles`. Those counters drive no port, so opt_clean deletes them
// from the netlist (docs/43 section 6.5): in silicon a corrected upset
// is indistinguishable from no upset, and on the mapped netlist the
// bench cannot read a counter that is not there.
//
// This module is the same count, made by the bench from the same
// inputs: the 31 registers' stored data and check bits, the scrub
// pointer, and the two read addresses -- all of which ARE flip-flops in
// the netlist and are read out of it by name (hw/soc/fi/gl_map.py
// generates the wiring, with the storage polarity the mapping found).
// The decoders are hw/rtl/secded_dec.v, read in place, exactly as the
// register file instantiates them.
//
// It is a bench instrument and not an operator channel, which is what
// the RTL counters were too. What it adds to the gate-level campaign is
// the CORRECTED class: without it every corrected upset would be MASKED
// and the reconciliation with docs/43 would fail on 190 records for a
// reason that has nothing to do with the netlist.
//
// The upper 32 data bits of each codeword are zero and the eighth check
// bit is zero, as in the register file (docs/43 section 6.3): the
// netlist has seven check flip-flops per register and this module
// supplies the constant.

  // THE SELECTS ARE WRITTEN OUT, NOT WRAPPED IN A FUNCTION, AND THAT IS

  // through `function rdata(input [4:0] a)` and assigned
  // `wire [31:0] raw_s = rdata(ptr_i);`.  A continuous assignment is
  // sensitive to the signals that appear in its expression, and
  // `data_i` appears only INSIDE the function body -- so Icarus
  // re-evaluated the select when the ADDRESS changed and not when the
  // storage did.  The scrub port holds its pointer for as long as the
  // core is writing, which is exactly when an upset is waiting to be
  // corrected, so the shadow reported a register as clean while the
  // flip-flop under it was corrupted: docs/74 section 9.3 group A, four
  // corrections missed and two invented over 180 records, found by
  // probing the shadow's own input beside its output.  With the select
  // in the expression the assignment is sensitive to both.
