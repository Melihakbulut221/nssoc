// Fault-injection testbench for the management core.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR
//
// `docs/38-ibex-bringup.md` section 10 item 4 records the owner choosing
// Ibex `small-pmp` over `small-pmp-sec` and states the obligation that
// follows: "the core needs its own fault-injection campaign ... An
// unmeasured block, in a design whose entire claim is *measured* fault
// tolerance, is the gap a reviewer finds before we do."  It also states
// the second, harder question -- the watchdog is "the only backstop
// currently planned ... Whether it suffices is open".
//
// This file is the instrument for both.  It runs the whole SoC of
// docs/39 and docs/40 with one bit of one core flip-flop flipped at one
// cycle, and it reports what came out of the pins.  `hw/soc/fi/campaign.py`
// is the classifier; this file measures and does not judge.
//
// THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS DELIBERATE.  Everything here is an
// observation.  Nothing here decides whether a run passed, because a
// testbench that classified would be a testbench that could be written
// around a result.  It emits one RECORD line of key=value facts and
// the campaign compares that against the golden run's.
//
// WHAT IS OBSERVED, AND WHY EACH ONE
//
//   uart_tx_o, decoded            the program's answer, over a pin, the
//                                 whole way through the fabric, the APB
//                                 bridge and the UART.  tb_soc.v's pass
//                                 criterion 4 is the same argument.
//   nmi_o, wdog_rst_o, wdog_no    the watchdog's three stages, as PORT
//                                 EVENTS with the cycle they happened
//                                 on.  This is the load-bearing one:
//                                 "the watchdog caught it" must be a
//                                 transition on a pin and never the
//                                 simulation running out of budget.
//                                 A run that ends on the budget with no
//                                 transition here is a HANG, and the
//                                 campaign cannot confuse the two.
//   core_sleep_o                  how the program says it has finished,
//                                 with the exit magic, exactly as
//                                 tb_soc.v requires.
//   alert_minor_o, alert_major_*  Ibex's own alert pins.
//   double_fault_seen_o           Ibex's own double-fault pin.
//
// and four words read out of RAM through a hierarchical reference, the
// same way tb_soc.v reads the exit code: `fi_sig`, `fi_mask`,
// `fi_rounds_done` and `trap_count`/`trap_mcause`.  Those are a
// convenience, not a pin -- a real bench would read them over the debug
// port or take them from the console -- and the campaign does not rest
// on any of them alone: the signature and the mask are also on the
// console, so the two paths can disagree and be caught disagreeing.
//
// THE INJECTION
//
// One bit, one flip-flop, one cycle, XORed in place.  The value stays
// flipped until the design's own logic writes the register again, which
// is the single-event-upset model docs/16 section 7.4 describes and the
// same one `hw/soc/tb/cocotb/test_soc_wdog_fi.py` uses.
//
// The deposit happens at a fixed point inside the cycle, after the
// clock edge and before the next one, so it can never race the design's
// own write.  `fi_before`, `fi_after` and `fi_w` are reported, so a
// deposit that did not land, or landed outside the register's width, is
// visible in the record rather than being a silent no-op that classifies
// MASKED.  docs/41 section 8.1's fourth honesty check is the same idea.
//
// The site table is `hw/soc/fi/targets.py` and is INCLUDED, not
// duplicated: that file generates the case statement below and the dump
// the campaign checks it against.
//
// WHAT THIS TESTBENCH DOES NOT DO
//
//   * it does not inject into anything outside `u_ibex` EXCEPT, since
//     docs/67, one word of one memory: +mem, +midx and +mbit name a
//     stored bit of the RAM or the boot ROM -- a data bit or, in the
//     hardened build, a check bit -- and the deposit lands there at
//     +cycle exactly as a core deposit would. hw/soc/fi/mem_campaign.py
//     draws those by region of the program's own link map. The fabric,
//     the CLINT, the timers and the watchdog itself are still not
//     targets here; the watchdog's own state is the subject of docs/41
//     section 8.
//   * it does not model a transient in combinational logic, a multi-bit
//     strike, or anything at gate level.
//   * it has no notion of a correct answer.  The golden run is the
//     campaign's, not this file's.
