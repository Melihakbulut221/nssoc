"""W7 and W8: the cadence contract and the kick budget.

WHERE THESE EXPECTATIONS COME FROM

They are the two requirements W7 and W8 stated in the header of
`hw/soc/rtl/soc_wdog.v` and argued in `docs/43-core-hardening.md`
sections 4 and 5.

**And a claim `test_soc_wdog.py` can make that this file cannot.** W1-W5
were written down before the RTL that implements them; W7 and W8 were
not -- the requirement and the implementation were written in the same
change, which is a weaker position and saying otherwise would be a
pretence. What is done instead is to keep the expectations at one
remove from the implementation in every case where that is possible:

  * every number below is computed from the requirement's own
    arithmetic -- "the window is open for the last 2^-WINS of the
    period" -- and from the block's parameters, and none is copied out
    of an expression in the design;
  * `test_the_window_boundary_is_where_the_requirement_says` does not
    assert a formula at all. It SWEEPS the tick at which the kick lands,
    finds the first one the block accepts, and compares that with the
    arithmetic. A shift the wrong way round, off by one, or taken
    against the counter instead of the reload would all still be a
    watchdog, and all three would fail here;
  * and the properties in `hw/soc/formal/soc_wdog_props.v` state the
    same requirements over the ports, where a k-induction proof rather
    than a stimulus decides them.

`test_soc_wdog.py`'s 14 tests continue to run unchanged against the same
file and are the regression that says W1-W5 did not move.

This file adds only what is new.

THE ONE MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN CHECK IN HERE is
`test_an_upset_in_the_unprotected_kick_budget_is_bounded`. `kick_left`
is deliberately outside W6's protected word, by the criterion `counter`
is outside it, and the price of that decision is measured here rather
than argued. `hw/soc/tb/cocotb/test_soc_wdog_fi.py` injects into it too,
but with a workload that never arms the budget -- so those injections
say only that a disarmed counter is inert, which is the weaker
statement. This one arms it first.

WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT COVER

  * The whole SoC. Whether a real program can live inside a window is a
    property of that program, and it is measured on the real fabric by
    `hw/soc/flow/fi_core.sh` and reported in docs/43 section 4.
  * Parameters other than the small ones the Makefile builds.
  * Any upset except the two deliberate deposits at the end. The
    protected word's own campaign is `test_soc_wdog_fi.py`.
  * WINDOW = 0. That configuration is proved rather than simulated:
    `hw/soc/formal/soc_wdog.sby` task `prove_w0`.
