"""Fault injection into the watchdog's own state.

WHY THIS EXISTS

`docs/40-interrupts-timers-watchdog.md` section 10 item 2 stated the gap
this campaign closes: "the block whose job is to catch upsets is itself
unprotected". `hw/soc/rtl/soc_wdog.v` W6 is the answer, and W6 makes two
claims that a proof cannot settle and an argument should not be trusted
with:

  1. an upset in the PROTECTED word is masked at the ports and counted;
  2. an upset in the DELIBERATELY UNPROTECTED state -- `counter`,
     `reload`, `pre` -- is bounded in time rather than permanent: the
     block recovers, the escalation ladder still completes, and the
     watchdog is still armed at the end.

The second is the one worth measuring, because it is the price of the
decision not to protect them. An argument that "the block rewrites it
anyway" is exactly the kind of reasoning
`docs/16-fault-injection-campaign.md` exists to replace with a number.

METHOD, adapted from docs/16 sections 1.2 to 1.6

  * The DUT is `soc_wdog` itself. **Only the stimulus reaches into the
    hierarchy.** Every observation is one a bench with a logic analyser
    and a register read could make: `nmi_o`, `rst_req_o`, `wdog_no`, and
    the four-bit register port. There is no pin that injects an upset.
  * Per injection: power-on reset, bring-up (program a short reload and
    kick, so the ladder takes hundreds of clocks instead of a million),
    then the workload, with one bit of one flip-flop XORed at a
    seeded-random cycle inside the measured window.
  * The GOLDEN MODEL decides right from wrong, always. It is a run of
    the same workload with no deposit, recorded once. The design's own
    flags only decide whether a wrong answer was *announced*; they are
    never allowed to declare an answer correct, which is why every
    record carries `out_ok` separately from its class.
  * Classification, exactly one class per injection, in this order:

      HANG       a bounded wait expired and nothing was flagged
      DETECTED   WDOGSTAT.TMRERR set, or TMRCNT nonzero
      SDC        the trace or the final reads differ from golden and
                 nothing was flagged
      CORRECTED  trace and final reads match golden and TMRCNT moved
      MASKED     matches golden and nothing moved

  * Four further per-record facts, because five classes cannot carry
    them and because the W6 argument is about them and not about the
    class:

      order_ok     the same escalation events in the same order,
                   ignoring WHEN they happened. A timing upset that
                   moves stage 1 by forty clocks is SDC against a
                   cycle-exact oracle and is not a lost backstop.
      ladder_ok    all three stages were still reached.
      armed_at_end EN still reads 1 and WDOGSTAT.DISABLED still reads 0.
                   This is the single post-condition the whole block
                   exists for, and the criterion in test_zz_summary that
                   would fail if `dis_q` were left unprotected.
      final_ok     the end-of-run register reads match golden, which is
                   the "bounded in time" half of claim 2.

WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN DOES **NOT** COVER

  * It is RTL, single-bit, flip-flop only. No gate-level netlist, no
    back-annotated timing, no multi-bit strike, no SET in combinational
    logic, no upset in the voter itself -- which is combinational and
    has no state, so an SET there is a different fault model this
    harness cannot express. docs/16 section 7.4 makes the same
    disclaimer at length.
  * It says nothing about RATES. Every number here is a conditional
    probability given that an upset landed in the injection window, on a
    uniform choice of target and bit. docs/16 section 7.5.
  * DETECTED depends on someone looking. WDOGSTAT.TMRERR and TMRCNT are
    registers; nothing raises an interrupt or a pin on them, and the
    software that would read them may be the thing that failed. docs/16
    section 7.6.
  * One workload, one parameter point (WIDTH 8, PRESCALE 4, RST_CYCLES
    8, ESCALATE 2), one seed. `soc_top.v` instantiates WIDTH 16 and
    PRESCALE 16 and nothing here runs at those.
  * It cannot fail because a replica vanished in synthesis. Every
    target path exists in the RTL whatever the netlist holds.
    `sw/tests/test_soc_synthesis_guards.py` is the separate,
    netlist-level criterion for that class and neither substitutes for
    the other.
  * The injection window is the workload. An upset during the bring-up
    writes, or during power-on reset, is not covered.

    This is the quantity W6's second list is an argument about. Saying

    2^WIDTH * PRESCALE clocks, the longest single timeout no software
    and no upset can produce, because no longer value fits in the
    counter.

    `gap` is the largest change to any single INTERVAL between
    consecutive escalation events -- one deadline. That is the quantity
    W2 bounds, and it is what the acceptance criterion is written over.

    `cum` is the largest change to an event's absolute cycle. It is NOT
    bounded by one timeout and this campaign measured why: an upset in
    `reload` persists across every deadline until a stage-2 reset
    restores the maximum, so its effect accumulates. The first version
    of the criterion here was written over `cum` and failed at 1,536
    clocks against a 1,024-clock bound -- correctly, because the
    criterion was wrong and not the design. Both numbers are reported;
    only `gap` is asserted.

    Both are None if the event sequences differ, in which case there is
