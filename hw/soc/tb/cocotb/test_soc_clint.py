"""soc_clint suite: the RISC-V machine timer and software interrupt.

WHERE THE EXPECTATIONS COME FROM. Three places, none of which is the RTL:

  * the RISC-V privileged specification's machine timer. mtime is a
    monotonically increasing counter; mtimecmp is a comparand; the timer
    interrupt is a LEVEL that is asserted exactly while
    mtime >= mtimecmp, unsigned, over the full 64 bits; the only way
    software clears it is by raising mtimecmp. msip's low bit is the
    machine software interrupt and nothing else in the word is;
  * the standard CLINT register layout that NOELVSYS places at
    0xE0000000 (docs/08-gr801-datasheet-notes.md section 2.2): msip at
    0x0000, mtimecmp at 0x4000, mtime at 0xBFF8;
  * the fabric slave contract S1-S4 quoted in the header of
    hw/soc/rtl/soc_bus.v: gnt when ready, exactly one rvalid per grant
    carrying rdata and err, in order.

The region base comes from sw/golden/memmap_gen.py, which is generated
from regmap/memmap.yaml, so no address literal for the block's base
appears below. The OFFSETS inside the block are the RISC-V layout above
and are written here because that is where they are defined.

The RTL was read for the port names and for the fact that rst_ni is
active low. Nothing below restates its structure.

WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT COVER
------------------------------
  * TICK_DIV other than 1. Every test here runs the block with mtime
    incrementing once per clock, which is how soc_top.v instantiates it.
    A divided time base is a parameter nothing exercises.
  * The 64-bit write hazard as a BUG. test_naive_mtimecmp_write_glitches
    demonstrates that the hazard is real and reachable; it does not
    claim the block avoids it, because the block deliberately does not
    (soc_clint.v's header says why). What is checked is that the
    documented sequence avoids it.
  * Any interaction with the core. Whether Ibex takes the interrupt this
    block raises is the whole-SoC run in hw/soc/flow/sim_soc.sh, not
    here.
  * Multi-hart layout. There is one hart; the offsets a second hart's
    msip and mtimecmp would occupy are checked to FAULT, which is a
    statement about this SoC and not about the CLINT specification.
  * Wrap of mtime past 2^64. Unreachable in any simulation.
  * Gate-level behaviour, timing, X-propagation and power.
  * Reset asserted mid-transaction. Nothing in the fabric contract says
    what that should do, so nothing is claimed.
