"""cocotb suite for hw/soc/rtl/soc_npu.v -- the CPU-side NPU interface
with the frozen pilot behind it.

WHAT IS UNDER TEST AND WHAT IS NOT
----------------------------------
The device under test is `soc_npu`, which INSTANTIATES hw/rtl/pilot_top.v
unmodified. So the pilot is in the loop and is not a model of one: every
register value below travels a real 40-bit serial frame into the frozen
submission and back, and every event travels either the parallel AER pins
or that same frame.

The pilot's OWN behaviour is not this suite's subject. hw/tb/test_pilot_top.py
covers it through the Tiny Tapeout pins and is the place a defect in the
die belongs. What is checked here is the CONNECTION: that the window
presents the architecture's register map at the architecture's offsets,
that reserved addresses fault, that the fabric slave contract is kept,
that the event port carries the docs/10 section 7.1 event stream in both
directions, and that the interrupt means what the register map says.

WHERE THE EXPECTATIONS COME FROM
--------------------------------
Nothing here is read out of hw/soc/rtl/soc_npu.v except the port names.

  - node register offsets, reset values and field positions come from
    sw/golden/regmap_gen.py, generated from regmap/regmap.yaml, which is
    the same single source that produces the die's own header;
  - the fabric slave contract is soc_bus.v's S1-S4, quoted in the
    docstrings that test it;
  - the serial frame format and its three host obligations are
    hw/rtl/pilot_top.v section 2, quoted where they are checked;
  - the inference answer is sw/golden/lif_core.py, the normative
    executable form of the docs/10 section 4 equations;
  - the NPUCFG block's own offsets are written here, because that block's
    register map has never been described anywhere else -- the same split
    docs/40 section 8.1 states for the CLINT and the GPTIMER.

WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT COVER
------------------------------
  - It never drives two masters, because soc_npu has one slave port. The
    arbitration consequence of a 172-cycle slave is a whole-SoC property
    and is measured there, not here.
  - It injects no upsets. The queues carry aer_fifo's parity and pointer
    voting; nothing here provokes either.
  - It runs at one geometry (8 x 8), one node, and SER_HALF = 2. The
    frame-length test is parameterised and the Makefile can raise
    SER_HALF, but no test sweeps it.
  - It says nothing about what happens if the die stops answering. There
    is no timeout in the transport, by design, and no test for one.

    """The cost of docs/77 section 11's grant, measured rather than priced.

    At WAKE_GNT = 0 a request that arrives while the block is asleep is
    granted in its own cycle: `req_i` is in the enable and the gate opens
    with it. At WAKE_GNT = 1 the block refuses that cycle, `wake_q` is set
    at the edge that ends it, and the grant comes in the next -- ONE
    cycle, asserted as exactly one and not as "at most". In neither
    configuration is a grant given with the enable low, and in both a
    request that finds the block AWAKE is granted in its own cycle: the
    price is per sleep interval and not per access, which is what makes
    docs/77 section 11's 56 the right count for the whole-SoC self-test.

    The APB face pays nothing in either configuration, and that is
    measured too: its SETUP cycle is the wake cycle, so PREADY is high at
    the first ACCESS cycle whether or not the block was asleep.
