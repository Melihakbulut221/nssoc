"""Fault injection into the CLINT's time base.

WHY THIS EXISTS

`docs/41` section 7.4 ranked `mtime` above everything the watchdog wave
left unprotected and then left it alone; `docs/43` section 12 and
`docs/44` section 3 deferred it twice more. `hw/soc/rtl/soc_clint.v` H6
is the answer, and it makes two claims that neither the proof nor an
argument can settle:

  1. a single-bit upset anywhere in mtime's 72 stored bits -- 64 data
     and 8 check -- leaves the ARCHITECTURAL CLOCK UNCHANGED at every
     port, and is announced on `mt_ecc_o`;
  2. the state H6 deliberately does NOT protect -- `mtimecmp`, `msip`
     and the bus response registers -- fails in a way this campaign can
     name, because the decision not to protect them is only a decision
     if its price is measured.

The second is where the design argument is. `soc_clint.v`'s H6 section
claims `mtimecmp` is neither persistent nor silent by `docs/41` section
3.1's criterion. That is an argument. This is the number.

METHOD, adapted from `docs/16` sections 1.2 to 1.6

  * The DUT is `soc_clint` itself. **Only the stimulus reaches into the
    hierarchy.** Every observation is one a bench could make: the two
    interrupt pins, the fault pin, and what a bus master reads back.
  * Per injection: reset, bring-up (seed mtime to a mid-mission value
    and arm a deadline), then the workload, with one bit of one
    flip-flop XORed at a seeded-random cycle inside the MEASURED window.
  * The GOLDEN MODEL decides right from wrong, always. It is a run of
    the same workload with no deposit, recorded once. `mt_ecc_o` only
    decides whether a wrong answer was ANNOUNCED; it never declares an
    answer correct, which is why every record carries `clock_ok`
    separately from its class.

MTIME IS SEEDED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BRING-UP

Out of reset mtime is zero and stays under 2^10 for the length of any
simulation anyone will run. A campaign drawn there would flip bit 47 of
a register whose bit 47 is zero, in a design where every deadline is
also small, and would report that the high half of the counter does not
matter. It matters for exactly the reason `docs/41` section 7.4 gives --
a flip in a high bit moves the clock by up to 2^63 ticks -- so the
workload WRITES mtime to a value with bits set across the whole word
before the injection window opens, using the architectural store this
block implements. MID_MTIME below is that value and section 3 of
`docs/58` says where it comes from.

CLASSIFICATION, exactly one class per injection, in `docs/16` section
1.6's order:

    HANG       a bounded wait expired and nothing was announced
    DETECTED   mt_ecc_o pulsed and the observation differs from golden
    SDC        the observation differs from golden and nothing pulsed
    CORRECTED  the observation matches golden and mt_ecc_o pulsed
    MASKED     matches golden and nothing pulsed

and four further per-record facts, because five classes cannot carry
them:

    clock_ok      every mtime a bus master read back was the value the
                  ARITHMETIC said it should be -- mtime minus the cycle
                  it was read on is a constant, which is C1 of
                  soc_clint_props.v restated as a measurement. THIS IS
                  THE COLUMN THE WHOLE DOCUMENT IS ABOUT: a wrong clock
                  that still fires its interrupt on time is the silent
                  failure docs/40 section 10 item 2 named. The oracle is
                  arithmetic and not a diff against golden for the
                  reason _epoch() records.
    deadline_ok   the timer interrupt rose on the golden cycle.
    clock_err     the largest absolute difference, in ticks, between a
                  read of mtime and what the arithmetic predicts. This
                  is the DISPLACEMENT, and it is the quantity docs/41
                  section 7.4 is an argument about.
    ecc_events    how many cycles mt_ecc_o was high.

WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN DOES **NOT** COVER

  * It is RTL, SINGLE-BIT, flip-flop only. No gate-level netlist, no
    back-annotated timing, no multi-bit strike, and no SET in
    combinational logic -- which for H6 is a larger gap than it is for
    a TMR block, because H6's defence is a combinational encoder and
    decoder and a transient inside either is a fault model this harness
    cannot express. `docs/58` section 10 states it at length.
  * Consequently THE UNCORRECTABLE CLASS IS EMPTY BY CONSTRUCTION. A
    double error needs two upsets in one 72-bit word inside one tick.
    `test_soc_clint.py` drives one directly, as a directed test rather
    than as a campaign draw, and asserts the codec does not miscorrect.
  * It says nothing about RATES. Every number is a conditional
    probability given that an upset landed in the window, on a uniform
    choice of target and bit. `docs/16` section 7.5.
  * DETECTED depends on someone looking. `mt_ecc_o` goes to a saturating
    counter in `soc_busstat.v` and nothing else; the software that would
    read it may be the thing that failed.
  * One workload, one seed, TICK_DIV = 1, and the block alone. Nothing
    here runs the CLINT inside the SoC with a core in front of it.
  * It cannot fail because the codec vanished in synthesis. Every target
    path exists in the RTL whatever the netlist holds, and
    `sw/tests/test_soc_synthesis_guards.py` is the separate,
    netlist-level criterion.

    wrong for a reason the campaign demonstrated: an upset in `mtimecmp`
    changes how long the RUN takes, so the final read-back happens at a
    different cycle, so mtime legitimately reads differently, and the
    harness reported 115 of 128 `mtimecmp` injections as having
    corrupted the clock. They had not. mtimecmp cannot reach mtime; the
    workload had simply moved underneath the measurement.

    What mtime actually promises is C1 of soc_clint_props.v: at
    TICK_DIV = 1 it advances exactly one per clock. So `mtime - cycle`
    is a CONSTANT for the whole run, the golden run measures that
    constant, and every read in every injected run is checked against
    it. The check is then independent of how long the run took, which is
    what makes it a check on the clock rather than on the schedule.
