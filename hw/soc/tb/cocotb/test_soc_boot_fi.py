"""Fault injection into the boot register block's own state.

WHY THIS EXISTS

`docs/68` section 12 states it in as many words: *"No fault-injection
campaign was re-run ... `soc_boot.v` is unprotected: an upset in the boot
counter changes a boot decision, an upset in the report corrupts a
diagnosis, and neither is voted, coded or scrubbed."* Section 16 item 1
then ranks hardening it first, because eight of the block's 92 flip-flops
decide whether the part tries to boot again.

So this campaign establishes the BASELINE as well as the delta, and the
two are kept apart everywhere: the numbers from `SOC_BOOT_FI_UNHARDENED`
are what the block docs/68 shipped does under upset, and the numbers from
the default build are what B1 does about it. Nothing in docs/68 is being
compared against; nothing in docs/68 measured this.

B1 makes three claims that neither a proof nor an argument can settle,
and each is an acceptance criterion in test_zz_summary:

  1. a single-bit upset anywhere in the 23 stored bits of any ONE
     replica leaves every register read UNCHANGED, and is announced in
     BSTAT.TMRERR/TMRCNT;
  2. the state B1 deliberately does NOT protect -- the two
     synchronisers, the system-reset sample, the report and the epoch --
     fails in a way this campaign can name, because the decision not to
     protect them is only a decision if its price is measured;
  3. nothing outside the protected word is announced, or the mismatch
     counter is a counter of something else's upsets.

METHOD, adapted from `docs/16` sections 1.2 to 1.6, and from
`test_soc_wdog_fi.py` and `test_soc_clint_fi.py` which are the two
campaigns this one is shaped after.

  * The DUT is `soc_boot` itself. **Only the stimulus reaches into the
    hierarchy.** Every observation is one a bench with a bus master and
    a reset pin could make: what a read of BSTRAP, BSTAT, BRPT and EPOCH
    returns, at a stamped cycle.
  * Per injection: power-on reset, then the workload, with one bit of
    one flip-flop XORed at a seeded-random cycle inside the measured
    window.
  * The GOLDEN MODEL decides right from wrong, always. It is a run of
    the same workload with no deposit. The design's own report only ever
    decides whether a wrong answer was ANNOUNCED; it never declares an
    answer correct.

THE WINDOW OPENS AT RESET RELEASE, WHICH IS NOT WHAT THE OTHER TWO
CAMPAIGNS DO, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE POINT

`test_soc_wdog_fi.py` and `test_soc_clint_fi.py` both put their bring-up
OUTSIDE the injection window, because in those blocks the bring-up is a
program writing configuration and an upset drawn there measures the
bring-up rather than the mission. **In this block the bring-up IS the
mission.** The straps are sampled three clocks after power-on reset
releases and never again; `armed_q` is set on that same release; the
whole of what this block decides is decided in the first four clocks of
a power cycle and then held for the rest of it. A campaign that opened
its window after the sample could never draw the upset that lands in the
sample, which is the one residual the unprotected synchronisers have.

So the window opens on the cycle after the power-on release and closes
before the final read-back, and `test_00_control` asserts that a draw at
the earliest cycle in the window is a draw before `BSTRAP.VALID` is set.

THE STRAP PATTERN IS 0b1001 AND THAT IS A DECISION, NOT A DEFAULT

`docs/58` section 8.1's lesson, one block across: a campaign drawn over
a field of zeros measures only the 0 -> 1 direction, and would report
that clearing a strap is impossible because there was nothing set to
clear. 0b1001 sets bits 0 and 3 and clears bits 1 and 2, so a drawn flip
is as likely to clear a one as to set a zero -- and, deliberately,
**NOBOOT (bit 2) is CLEAR on the board**, so an upset that sets it is a
part that refuses to load an image for the rest of the power cycle.
That is the failure `noboot_set` counts.

CLASSIFICATION, exactly one class per injection, in `docs/16` section
1.6's order:

    HANG       a bounded wait expired, or the slave stopped completing
    DETECTED   the report moved and the observation differs from golden
    SDC        the observation differs from golden and nothing was
               reported
    CORRECTED  the observation matches golden and the report moved
    MASKED     matches golden and nothing was reported

and eight further per-record facts, because five classes cannot carry
them and the ranking in soc_boot.v's B1 section is entirely about them:

    cnt_ok         every read of BSTAT.CNT was the golden value. THE
                   COLUMN THE DOCUMENT IS ABOUT.
    cnt_err        the largest absolute displacement of BSTAT.CNT, in
                   boots.
    gave_up_early  at some read, OVER was set while golden's was clear:
                   THE LOADER DOES NOT TOUCH THE FLASH ON A PART THAT
                   STILL HAD ATTEMPTS LEFT, and the counter is
                   saturating and power-on-only, so it stays that way
                   for the power cycle. A mission that stops retrying
                   after one spurious increment is lost.
    never_gives_up at the last read of the window, golden's OVER was set
                   and this run's was not: THE LADDER DOES NOT
                   TERMINATE. The watchdog cannot break the loop,
                   because docs/68 section 5.4's loader kicks it from
                   inside the copy.
    strap_ok       every read of the strap field was what the board
                   wired.
    noboot_set     NOBOOT read as 1 on a board that strapped it 0.
    valid_lost     BSTRAP.VALID read as 0 after it had read 1 -- the
                   sampling window reopened, which is soc_wdog.v W1's
                   hardware back door into the boot decision.
    record_ok      BRPT and EPOCH read back what was written.

WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN DOES **NOT** COVER

  * It is RTL, SINGLE-BIT, flip-flop only. No gate-level netlist, no
    back-annotated timing, no multi-bit strike, and no single-event
    transient in combinational logic -- which includes the voter, which
    has no state to inject into, and the whole of the next-state
    function.
  * TWO UPSETS ARE NOT COVERED and nothing about three replicas claims
    they are. soc_tmr_bank is written unconditionally every clock, which
    bounds the window in which a second upset in a different replica on
    the same bit is uncorrectable to ONE CLOCK CYCLE; it does not
    eliminate it, and in this block no reset ever repairs the word.
  * It says nothing about RATES. Every number is conditional on an upset
    having landed in the window, on a uniform choice of target and bit.
  * DETECTED depends on someone looking. BSTAT.TMRERR and TMRCNT are
    register fields; this block has no interrupt line and the map gives
    it none, so the only reader is the next boot's loader.
  * ONE WORKLOAD, ONE SEED, and the block alone. Nothing here runs
    soc_boot inside the SoC with a core and a loader in front of it, so
    the consequences named in the fact columns above are consequences
    the LOADER would draw from what it read, argued from
    hw/soc/tb/sw/boot.c and not run.
  * It cannot fail because a replica vanished in synthesis. Every target
    path exists in the RTL whatever the netlist holds;
    `sw/tests/test_soc_synthesis_guards.py` is the separate,
    netlist-level criterion and neither substitutes for the other.

    # and `dly` in the unprotected build came back MASKED.

    # This test is why. `dly` SATURATES at 2 -- it stops incrementing on
    # the clock the sample is taken -- so clearing `valid_q` does not
    # restart a three-clock delay; it re-latches `sync1` on the VERY
    # NEXT CLOCK. And `sync1` is two flops behind pins that a board
    # holds static, so what a reopened window latches is the value that
    # was already there.
