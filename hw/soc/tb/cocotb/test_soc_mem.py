"""soc_mem suite: the memory as a FABRIC SLAVE, at both response latencies.

Every expectation here comes from one of two specifications and not from
the RTL:

  * the slave contract S1-S4 in the header of hw/soc/rtl/soc_bus.v, which
    is itself Ibex's load/store-unit protocol (rules 1-4) restated from
    the slave side: always answer a granted request exactly once, carry
    rdata and err in that cycle, never answer in the grant cycle, never
    reorder, never limit the master;

  * hw/soc/rtl/soc_mem.v's own header, which states what RDREG is and
    what it does NOT change -- gnt stays combinational from req, so the
    memory still accepts a request every cycle, and the extra cycle is
    LATENCY and not throughput. It also states that the write response is
    delayed with the read response, because rule 4 makes the latency a
    property of the slave rather than of the access.

WHY THIS SUITE IS NEW. Before docs/50 this module was one always block
and the whole-SoC run was proportionate verification of it. docs/50 gives
it a second response stage, and a slave with two arms and a parameter
that selects between them is a protocol obligation that has to be checked
directly: the system-level run only exercises the memory through Ibex, so
a defect Ibex does not happen to provoke would not appear there.

THE SAME TESTS RUN AT BOTH RDREG VALUES. Not one set for each: the
protocol is identical at both, only the latency differs, and the whole
point is that nothing except the latency moved. `LATENCY` below is
MEASURED from the DUT in test_the_latency_is_the_one_that_was_built and
every later test uses the measured value, so a build whose parameter
override was dropped fails the first test instead of quietly passing the
other arm's suite.

WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT COVER
------------------------------
  * hw/soc/rtl/soc_mem_sram.v. That file declares the same module name and
    the same protocol, and cannot be simulated without the PDK's macro
    models. What is checked of it here is nothing; what is checked of it
    at all is the synthesis parameter guard in
    sw/tests/test_soc_memory_guards.py and the netlist docs/50 hardens.
  * The behaviour of two masters, arbitration, or anything above this
    port. That is soc_bus's suite.
  * Timing, X-propagation and reset in the middle of an outstanding
    request. The last is a real gap and it is the same gap
    test_soc_bus.py declares.
  * INIT_FILE. The suite runs with an empty image and writes what it
    reads back.
