/* NPUCFG register map, for the bare-metal program.
 *
 * This is the FABRIC-LEVEL block's own map -- the event port and the
 * interrupt -- and it is written here rather than generated, exactly as
 * soc_timers.h is for the GPTIMER and for the same reason: regmap/
 * memmap.yaml says where a block lives and has never said what is
 * inside one (docs/40 section 8.1). The base address IS generated, from
 * soc_memmap.h, so nothing here knows where the slot is.
 *
 * The NODE register map is a different thing entirely and is NOT here.
 * It is docs/10 section 10, it has a single source in
 * regmap/regmap.yaml, and the program reaches it through the generated
 * npu_regs.h and the memory-mapped window at SOC_NPU_BASE.
 *
 * The block is hw/soc/rtl/soc_npu.v and its header is the contract.

/* IRQ_CAUSE. b0..b4 are LEVELS: a write to one is accepted and does
 * nothing, because the way to clear a level is to fix what raises it.
 * b5 upward are STICKY and write-1-to-clear.
 *
 * b7..b11 were added by docs/55 and every one of them answers a number
 * docs/52 measured:
 *
 *   SER_TO   soc_npu_ser.v's frame bound aborted a serial frame. Before
 *            docs/55 the same corruption was a frame that never ended
 *            and a CPU that stalled for ever -- 5 of the 7 dead machines
 *            in 600 injections.
 *   WIN_TO   the node register window's own response bound expired,
 *            which is the other 2 of the 7.
 *   Q_COR    aer_fifo's pointer vote CORRECTED a replica disagreement.
 *            74 of these in 700 injections were invisible to every
 *            operator channel before this bit existed.
 *   Q_DET    a queue entry was DISCARDED -- a failed entry parity or a
 *            rd_valid rail disagreement. An event was lost.
 *   CFG_TMR  the voter over this register's own triple-redundant bank
 *            masked a mismatch. The report is a FIELD OF THE PROTECTED
 *            WORD, so the upset that caused it is corrected and recorded
 *            by the same write on the same edge.
 *
 * A SER_TO or a WIN_TO also FAILS the access that provoked it, so
 * software normally learns of those from a load access fault first and
 * reads this register to find out which of the two it was.
 *
 * b12 was added by docs/56:
 *
 *   OH_TO    the show-ahead adapter issued a read of the capture queue
 *            that produced no rd_valid inside its bound, and took its
 *            own request back so the read could be re-issued. Before
 *            that bound existed one such read stopped the block
 *            delivering events FOR GOOD, with EVT still reporting that
 *            one was waiting -- so a driver polling EVQ_OUT polled for
 *            ever. It is reachable from a discarded capture entry as
 *            well as from an upset in the flag.
 *   AER_MM   the AER strobe flag and the event engine's state, which
 *            imply each other on a healthy part, disagreed. The strobe
 *            into the die was held quiet. docs/56 measured an upset in
 *            that ONE flip-flop producing a silent wrong inference in 18
 *            of 18 draws -- a phantom spike the die accepted as real --
 *            which is the highest per-bit rate this block has measured.
 *            It DETECTS and does not correct: held quiet is right when
 *            the flag was corrupted and loses an event when the state
 *            was, and the block cannot tell which. */
