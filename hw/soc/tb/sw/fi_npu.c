// The workload the NPU-connection fault-injection campaign of docs/52
// runs.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT fi_workload.c AND NOT test_ibex.c
//
// `hw/soc/tb/sw/fi_workload.c` is docs/42's kernel. It exercises the
// CORE and touches nothing in the NPU, so an upset in the transport, the
// event engine or the node window would be MASKED in every draw. It is
// the wrong workload for this campaign for the same reason test_ibex.c
// was the wrong workload for that one.
//
// `hw/soc/tb/sw/test_ibex.c` check 26 IS this inference, and it is
// 213,971 cycles with 27 checks and four deliberate traps. All three
// properties are wrong for a campaign that runs the program a thousand
// times and treats an unexpected trap as an announcement.
//
// So this is a third workload: the docs/51 section 7 demonstration and
// nothing else, as short as it can be made, with everything the campaign
// needs published as a word.
//
// THE ORACLE IS THE GOLDEN MODEL, AND THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE FROM docs/42
//
// docs/42 section 3 had to settle for "an undeposited run of the same
// program on the same design" as its oracle, and said so at length:
// it measures DEVIATION and not CORRECTNESS, and it licenses no claim
// about latent corruption -- "an upset that leaves a register wrong in a
// way THIS PROGRAM never reads is MASKED here".
//
// Here the oracle is available. `hw/soc/flow/gen_npu_vectors.py` runs
// `sw/golden/lif_core.py` -- which docs/10 section 13 makes the
// normative executable form of the section 4 equations -- at BUILD TIME
// and emits the expected event stream and the expected neuron state file
// as constants. This program compares against those constants. So:
//
//   * a corrupted inference is a WRONG ANSWER against the specification,
//     not merely a difference from another run of the same RTL;
//   * and the neuron state file read back at the end is an
//     ARCHITECTURAL-STATE oracle for the NPU. An upset that leaves V or
//     R wrong without producing a wrong spike inside this stimulus is
//     caught here. docs/16 section 1.6 names that class and keeps
//     `spikes_ok` and `state_ok` apart; this program does the same, in
//     two bits of `fi_mask`.
//
// That is what the campaign spends the extra checks on, and docs/52
// section 5.2 measures how many records it actually separated.
//
// THE SELF-CHECKS ARE A DETECTION CHANNEL *AND* AN ORACLE HERE, AND THE
// TWO ROLES ARE KEPT APART ANYWAY
//
// `fi_mask` is nonzero when the program noticed. That is a detection
// channel, exactly as in docs/42. What is different is that the thing it
// compared against is the specification, so the campaign is additionally
// entitled to read `fi_mask` bits 1..3 as "the inference was wrong".
// `hw/soc/fi/npu_campaign.py` uses them in both roles and labels which
// is which; it still decides MASKED from the whole compared result and
// never from `fi_mask` alone.
//
// THE WORDS THE TESTBENCH READS
//
//   fi_phase   0 before the measured kernel, 1 during it, 2 after. The
//              testbench records the cycle of each transition and the
//              campaign draws inside [1, 2), so the window is MEASURED
//              and not assumed -- docs/41 section 8.1's last honesty
//              clause, inherited unchanged.
//   fi_sig     a 32-bit fold of the whole collected event stream and the
//              whole neuron state file. The program's answer.
//   fi_mask    which self-checks failed. Zero in the clean run.
//   fi_rounds_done  frames whose barrier came back. 6 in the clean run.
//
// and six more that are TELEMETRY THE PROGRAM READ WITH A LOAD, not
// bench observations: fi_nev, fi_cause, fi_drop, fi_ovf, fi_oor,
// fi_status. docs/44 section 8.2 makes the distinction that matters
// here -- a counter a testbench reads hierarchically is not a counter an
// operator can see, and these six are the ones an operator can.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ARMED
//
// The NPUCFG interrupt. `irq_mask` resets to zero and this program never
// writes it, so the interrupt line never rises. That is not laziness: an
// armed interrupt would put the cause register's contents on the
// program's control flow, and the campaign wants the cause register
// measured as a REPORT -- what the operator is told -- rather than as a
// branch. docs/52 section 9 states what that leaves uncovered.
