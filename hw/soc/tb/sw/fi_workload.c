// The workload the core fault-injection campaign of docs/42 runs.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT test_ibex.c
//
// `hw/soc/tb/sw/test_ibex.c` is the bring-up program of docs/38, docs/39
// and docs/40. It is 22 checks, 185,443 cycles on the SoC, and it traps
// on purpose four times. All three properties are wrong for a campaign
// that runs the program hundreds of times and treats a trap as an
// announcement:
//
//   * 185,443 cycles is about 50 s of Icarus per injection. A campaign
//     of 480 injections run twice would be a fortnight.
//   * a program that traps on purpose cannot use "an unexpected trap
//     happened" as a detection channel, because the classifier would
//     have to know which traps were meant.
//   * its checks are wide but shallow in time: most of the run is
//     console output, and an upset drawn uniformly in it lands in the
//     UART wait loop far more often than in anything interesting.
//
// So this is a separate, deliberately short, deliberately dense
// workload. It is NOT a replacement for test_ibex.c and nothing here
// should be read as re-running the bring-up suite.
//
// WHAT IT IS
//
// A fixed number of rounds. Each round exercises, on data it derives
// itself, the structures the campaign strata are drawn over: the
// register file (deep expression trees and a recursive call), the
// fetch path (a data-dependent loop), the controller (branches and
// calls), the load/store unit (byte, half and word accesses at every
// alignment), the multiplier and divider (RV32M in both directions),
// and the machine CSRs (a read-modify-write of mscratch). The watchdog
// is kicked several times inside every round, so the interval between
// kicks stays well under the timeout the program arms and the clean run
// never escalates.
//
// THE SELF-CHECKS CARRY NO EXTERNAL CONSTANTS, ON PURPOSE
//
// docs/38 section 7.5 defect 1 records four hand-computed expected
// values in the bring-up program, all four wrong, all four caught by
// the core being right. A campaign program that carried a table of
// expected results would carry the same risk with nobody to catch it.
//
// Every check here is therefore a DUAL COMPUTATION: the same quantity
// derived two structurally different ways, compared against each other.
// A sum forwards against a sum backwards; a hardware multiply against a
// shift-and-add loop; a hardware divide against its own reconstruction
// q*d + r; a recursive Fibonacci against an iterative one; a checksum
// accumulated while writing memory against one computed by reading it
// back at a different access width. None of them can be wrong in the
// way a transcribed constant can be wrong, and each of them fails if
// exactly one of its two computations is disturbed.
//
// This is a DETECTION channel and not the oracle. What decides right
// from wrong is the golden run -- docs/42 section 3. `fail_mask` says
// whether the program itself noticed, which is a different and weaker
// question, and the campaign keeps the two apart.
//
// THE THREE WORDS THE TESTBENCH READS
//
//   fi_phase  0 before the measured kernel, 1 during it, 2 after. The
//             testbench records the cycle of each transition and the
//             campaign draws its injection cycles inside [1, 2). The
//             window is therefore MEASURED from the clean run rather
//             than assumed, which is docs/41 section 8.1's last
//             honesty clause.
//   fi_sig    a 32-bit signature folding every intermediate result of
//             every round. It is the program's answer.
//   fi_mask   which self-checks failed. Zero in the clean run.
//
// They are also printed on the console, so the same three facts reach
// the testbench by two independent paths -- a hierarchical read of RAM
// and a decode of the UART pin. tb_soc.v's pass criterion 4 makes the
// same argument.

/* ---- the windowed variant, docs/43 ---------------------------------
 *
 * FI_WINDOWED builds the same kernel under soc_wdog.v's W7 cadence
 * contract and W8 kick budget. It is a SEPARATE BUILD and not a runtime
 * option because it changes the program, and docs/43 keeps the two
 * campaigns apart for exactly that reason: campaign A runs this file
 * with FI_WINDOWED off, which is byte-for-byte the docs/42 workload, so
 * the register-file result is measured with the software held fixed.
 *
 * WHY THE KICKS HAD TO MOVE. Measured on the unmodified program: 25
 * kicks in the window, shortest interval 30 clocks, longest 1,716 --
 * a jitter ratio of 57. W7 with WINS = 1 permits 2. The ordinary way to
 * use a watchdog -- kick wherever the code happens to pass -- cannot
 * live inside any window at all, and that is a real cost of W7 and not
 * a defect of this program.
 *
 * So the windowed build kicks EXACTLY ONCE PER ROUND, at the top of the
 * round, and nowhere else. The interval is then one round of the kernel
 * and its jitter is whatever the kernel's own data-dependent branching
 * produces -- which is what a program written to live inside a window
 * has to look like, and which docs/43 section 4 measures.
