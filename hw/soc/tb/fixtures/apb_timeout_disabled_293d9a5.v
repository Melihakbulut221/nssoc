// System bus to AMBA APB bridge.
//
// This is the one place in the SoC where a standard bus protocol is
// implemented rather than declined, and docs/39-soc-bus-and-memory-map.md
// section 4 is the argument for why here and not on the system side. In
// short: APB is small enough that compliance can be PROVED rather than
// asserted -- the state machine has three states and the protocol has
// eight rules -- and the peripheral register maps this project is
// mirroring from GRLIB (docs/08 section 3 rows 8-12) are written against
// APB semantics.
//
// Protocol implemented: AMBA 3 APB. Every transfer is
//
//   IDLE    PSEL = 0, PENABLE = 0
//   SETUP   PSEL = 1, PENABLE = 0        exactly one cycle
//   ACCESS  PSEL = 1, PENABLE = 1        until PREADY
//
// with PADDR, PWRITE, PWDATA and PSTRB held stable from SETUP through
// ACCESS, and PSLVERR sampled only in the cycle PREADY is high.
//
// The formal properties in hw/soc/formal/soc_apb_bridge_props.v state
// those rules over this module's PORTS. They were written from the APB
// specification and from the Ibex protocol quoted in soc_bus.v, not from
// the code below -- this repository has twice locked in a bug by
// asserting that an implementation is correct (docs/09 section on
// vacuity, and the npu_regbank episode), so a property here that merely
// restated the state encoding would be worth nothing.
//
// SLAVE SIDE, toward the fabric: this bridge accepts ONE request at a
// time and withholds gnt otherwise. soc_bus.v rule S4 permits that. The
// cost is that a peripheral access takes three cycles back to back
// (accept, SETUP, ACCESS+PREADY, with rvalid overlapping the next
// accept) instead of the one cycle the RAM takes. That is the price of
// APB and it is charged only to peripheral traffic.
//
// PSEL DECODE IS NOT HERE. This module drives a single psel_o meaning
// "the bridge is selecting some peripheral" plus paddr_o; the per-slot
// PSEL comes from soc_top.v, which is where the generated slot constants
// live. A bridge that decoded slots itself would be a second copy of the
// memory map.
