"""Compute a floorplan for soc_top and emit it as LibreLane -c overrides.

docs/47 section 8.4 measured that its floorplan is the most likely
explanation for 7.07 ns of the 7.07 ns layout cost, and section 9 said
plainly that the die dimensions and the channel height "are one point in
a space nobody has explored".  This file is what explores it, and it
exists rather than a second hand-edited config.json for three reasons:

  1. THE MACRO SIZES ARE READ, NOT TYPED.  W and H come from the LEF
     `SIZE` statement of the installed PDK.  A floorplan whose macro
     dimensions are transcribed is a floorplan that can disagree with
     the library it is placed against, silently, and only OpenROAD's
     overlap checker would notice -- and only if the error made things
     overlap rather than leaving a gap.

  2. SITE ALIGNMENT IS ASSERTED, NOT ARRANGED.  docs/47 section 6.1
     established that the core box is an integer number of 0.48 um
     sites wide and 3.78 um rows tall, and every macro origin an
     integer number of sites and rows from the core's lower left.  That
     property is easy to state and easy to lose by hand; here it is
     checked, and the script refuses to emit a floorplan that has lost
     it.

  3. THE VARIABLE IS ONE NUMBER.  docs/47's floorplan and every
     floorplan this file emits differ in the CHANNEL HEIGHT and in
     nothing else: the same six macros, the same two rows, the same
     orientations, the same x origins, the same margins.  docs/47
     section 6.1's argument for that arrangement -- every RM_IHPSG13
     part puts all of its signal pins on one edge, so both rows' pin
     edges must face the channel -- is not re-litigated here, it is
     inherited.  What is being measured is the SIZE of the box, because
     that is what docs/47 got wrong: it sized the channel against
     LibreLane's own synthesis of the same RTL, which is 32 % larger
     than the netlist actually hardened.

Usage:

    floorplan.py --channel 700.08          # docs/47's floorplan, exactly
    floorplan.py --channel 310.74 --args   # emit -c overrides for librelane

The channel height is quantised: the top macro row's origin must be an
integer number of 3.78 um rows above the core's bottom edge, and the
bottom row's origin is fixed, so the admissible channel heights are
0.78 + 3.78k um.  --channel snaps to the nearest and says so.

#
# docs/67 section 8's open item, closed. The paragraph above is left as
# it was written because it is still true of `--memory ecc`; what is new
# is `--memory ecc-rom`, which places the two check macros and therefore
# does NOT force ROM_HARDEN = 0.
#
# WHERE THEY GO, AND WHY THERE IS ROOM AT ALL. The macro rows are as
# tall as the RAM, 626.70 um, and the ROM is 336.46 um, so column 2 has
# 290.24 um of unused height in each row. The check macro is 191.34 um
# tall and 236.80 um wide against the ROM's 416.64, so it fits inside
# that pocket twice over. Nothing else in the floorplan has to move to
# make room -- the die, the core and the four RAM macros are untouched,
# which is what keeps every measurement taken on this floorplan
# comparable with one taken on the new one.
#
# WHY THE BOTTOM ROM MOVES AND THE TOP ONE DOES NOT. Both rows put their
# pin edge against the channel: the bottom row is FS, which mirrors the
# macro about X and lifts its pins to its top, and the top row is N,
# which leaves them at its bottom. So the pocket in the BOTTOM row lies
# on top of the ROM, directly over its pins, and a macro parked there
# would sit across every wire leaving them. The bottom ROM is therefore
# raised to the top of its own band -- its pins end up at the channel
# rather than 290 um below it, which is better for it as well -- and the
# check macro takes the space underneath, on the ROM's blind edge. The
# top row needs none of this: its ROM's pins are already at the bottom
# of the band facing the channel, and the pocket is above, on its blind
# edge.
#
# Both check macros keep their row's orientation, so each one's pins
# face the same way as the ROM it serves.

# docs/47's arrangement is three macro columns per row -- RAM, RAM, ROM
# -- which makes the core 2186.40 um wide because the row is 2065.92 um
# wide, and the standard cells then live in a channel that is as wide as
# the row.  Its two consequences are measured in docs/48: the logic is a
# strip, and the ROMs, being 290.24 um shorter than the RAM, leave two
# POCKETS at the far right of the die which a tighter channel fills with
# exiled logic.
#
# This arrangement takes the ROMs out of the rows.  Two RAM columns make
# the row 1609.12 um wide, the core 1730.40, and the two ROMs are placed
# as islands INSIDE the channel with clear standard-cell area above and
# below each -- orientation N, so their pin edge faces down into the
