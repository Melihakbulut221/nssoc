"""The CLINT placement region of docs/73: derive the cell set, write the
constraint into a saved OpenDB database, and read the result back.

docs/72 section 6.4 found both layouts of docs/70 splitting the CLINT's
32-bit response register across the upper ROM macro, and section 15 item 1
asked for one placement probe: the CLINT's read mux and its response
register on one side of that macro, with the crossing count on the worst
path as the metric. This file is that probe's whole mechanism, in four
subcommands so that every number docs/73 quotes has a command behind it.

  members  <netlist.v> [--write members.json]
      The cell set. The design is flattened before abc (flow/syn_soc_top.sh
      runs `synth -flatten` and then `abc`), so no module boundary survives
      in the netlist; what survives are NET NAMES. The set is therefore
      derived, not read:
        seeds  = every cell whose output drives a net named `u_clint.*` or
                 `s_rdata_clint[*]` -- the CLINT's own registers (mtimecmp,
                 the mtime codeword, its check bits, rvalid_o, err_o), the
                 fabric's 32 registered response bits, and the combinational
                 drivers of the named CLINT nets;
        cone   = fixpoint over "a cell belongs if EVERY load of EVERY one of
                 its outputs already belongs, and no output touches a port
                 or a macro pin" -- the logic that feeds nothing but the
                 CLINT. This is the read mux and the SECDED decode/encode of
                 mtime; it stops at the first net a second block also
                 reads, which is where the address decode becomes the
                 fabric's rather than the CLINT's.
      A plain backward cone from the response flops does NOT work on this
      netlist: it runs through the fabric's address mux, the Ibex ALU and
      the register file's read multiplexer and returns 4,036 cells, because
      after `abc` that is one combinational cloud. The exclusive rule is
      what makes "the CLINT" a well-defined set of cells here, and docs/73
      section 3 states what it leaves out.

  apply    --odb-in <odb> --members members.json --box x0 y0 x1 y1
           --odb-out <odb> --def-out <def> [--state-in s.json --state-out s.json]
      Runs under `openroad -python`. Creates one dbRegion with the box as
      its boundary, one dbGroup inside it, and adds every member instance to
      the group. The installed OpenROAD (26Q1-2938-g0e2d771c5e) honours
      exactly this in both placers: gpl builds a separate placement problem
      per group whose bounding box is the region and BLOCKS the region's
      sites for every other cell (src/gpl/src/placerBase.cpp, "Initialize
      Region" and the siteGrid marking); dpl legalises group cells inside
      their region and keeps the rest out (src/dpl/src/Opendp.cpp,
      groupAssignCellRegions). Nothing else in the database is touched, and
      the DEF written beside the ODB is the step's own DEF plus a REGIONS
      and a GROUPS section, which is how the edit is checked. The box must
      lie on the site grid (0.48 um from the core's left edge, 3.78 um from
      its bottom) so that dpl does not invalidate a half-covered pixel row;
      the script asserts it. With --state-in the LibreLane state file of the
      step whose ODB was edited is copied with its `odb` and `def` entries
      pointed at the new files, which is what the resume form consumes.

  census   <soc_top.def> [--members members.json]
      Standard cells by die zone, docs/72 section 6.4's convention: the
      channel between the macro rows; the pocket above the upper ROM and
      the one above the lower ROM (each including the 60.48 um strip beside
      it at that height); the strip beside the ROMs themselves; elsewhere.
      Reproduces docs/72's 45,619 / 2,222 / 3,568 / 441 / 436 on s71boot's
      step-26 DEF.

  path     <max.rpt> <soc_top.def> [--members members.json] [--nth N]
      The N-th path of an OpenSTA report, one row per driver stage: cell,
      load, delay, placement, zone, CLINT membership, and whether the net
      from the previous driver crosses a ROM macro (one end in a pocket, the
      other not in that pocket or the strip beside it). Stops at the data
      arrival line, so the capture clock's buffers are not counted as
      stages. Reproduces docs/72 section 6.4's "2" on s71boot's step-37
      report.

The geometry -- macro origins, sizes, the channel bounds -- is the one
docs/59 section 4.2 extracted and config-ecc.json states; it is written
here as numbers rather than parsed so that the script has no dependency on
a run directory being present. Standard library only, except `apply`.

Nothing here writes into any existing run directory or into the
configuration; the probe's constraint is a database edit between two
steps of the flow, and docs/73 section 4 says why that form was chosen.
